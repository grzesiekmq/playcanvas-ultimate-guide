Chapter 49 â€“ Debugging and Profiling Techniques

Effective debugging and profiling are crucial for maintaining high-quality PlayCanvas projects and optimizing performance.

1. Debugging Tools

Use browser developer tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Edition) for inspecting JavaScript and WebGL contexts.

Utilize PlayCanvas built-in console logs and error messages.

Add custom debug outputs within scripts using console.log() and conditional breakpoints.


2. Profiling Performance

Analyze CPU and GPU usage via browser profiling tools.

Monitor frame rates and memory usage to identify bottlenecks.

Use PlayCanvas Stats panel for real-time performance metrics.


3. Common Issues and Fixes

Identify and resolve memory leaks by monitoring object creation and destruction.

Track down rendering glitches by isolating shaders or materials causing issues.

Debug physics problems by visualizing collision shapes and constraints.


4. Best Practices

Keep a development build separate from production to include debug aids.

Use source maps for easier debugging of minified code.

Continuously profile during development cycles.
