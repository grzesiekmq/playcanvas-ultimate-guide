Chapter 18: Animations and State Graphs

Animating objects and characters in PlayCanvas is essential for creating interactive and immersive scenes. The platform provides a robust animation system based on animation components, state graphs, and events. This chapter covers everything from importing animations to triggering them dynamically.

18.1 Types of Animations in PlayCanvas

There are several kinds of animations you can use:

Skeletal animation: Used for characters, creatures, or anything rigged with bones (e.g., walking, jumping).

Node animation: Moves, rotates, or scales entities over time (e.g., a door opening).

Material animation: Changes visual properties (e.g., transparency or color).

Custom animation: Procedural animation driven via code.



---

18.2 Importing Animations

Animations typically come from external 3D modeling software (Blender, Maya) in formats like .fbx or .glb.

When you import a model with animations:

1. PlayCanvas detects the animation clips.


2. These are available in the Assets panel.


3. You can drag and drop them onto an entity with an animation or anim component.




---

18.3 Using the Anim Component

The animation component is the legacy system. It plays one animation at a time. Example:

this.entity.animation.play('run');

However, the modern approach uses the Anim component, which supports state machines and blending.


---

18.4 Adding the Anim Component

1. Select an entity (e.g., your character root).


2. Add the anim component.


3. Assign an AnimStateGraph asset.


4. Drag animation clips into the Anim section of the entity.



You can build the AnimStateGraph using the Graph Editor in the PlayCanvas editor.


---

18.5 Creating an Animation State Graph

A state graph is a visual way to manage animation states (e.g., Idle → Walk → Run) and define transitions between them.

Each state:

Is tied to an animation clip.

Can have transition conditions (e.g., speed > 0.5).

May blend into another state smoothly.


Transitions are defined with parameters like speed, jump, or custom flags.


---

18.6 Using Parameters in State Graphs

Parameters are values that influence transitions:

Bool: true/false (e.g., isJumping)

Float: number (e.g., speed)

Trigger: fires once (e.g., jumpNow)


You set parameters in script:

this.entity.anim.setFloat('speed', 1.0);
this.entity.anim.setTrigger('jumpNow');


---

18.7 Transition Blending

PlayCanvas supports blending between animation clips, making transitions smooth and realistic.

Each transition can define a blend time (e.g., 0.2 seconds).

You can adjust this in the graph editor or in JSON state machine definitions.


---

18.8 Animation Events

Animations can trigger events embedded in their timeline. For example, a footstep sound at frame 12.

To respond to events:

this.entity.anim.on('footstep', function () {
    this.app.fire('audio:playFootstep');
}, this);

These events are set up in the animation track in external tools (e.g., Blender) or through PlayCanvas's import system.


---

18.9 Runtime Control of Animations

At runtime, you can:

Switch states by updating parameters.

Reset animations.

Pause/resume animations.

Adjust playback speed:


this.entity.anim.speed = 1.5; // 1.0 is default


---

18.10 Troubleshooting Animation Issues

Model doesn't animate? Check the root bone is mapped correctly.

State doesn’t change? Verify parameter names and values match the state graph.

Animation looks wrong? Ensure skeletons match between animations.

Laggy transitions? Lower blend time or simplify state graph.
