Chapter 50 â€“ Creating Interactive Product Configurators

Product configurators are a popular use case for PlayCanvas in e-commerce and marketing. This chapter focuses on designing interactive experiences where users can customize 3D products in real time.

1. Use Case Overview

Product configurators allow users to:

Change product colors, materials, or parts.

Rotate and zoom to inspect the product.

Export or save their configuration.


Examples include car customizers, furniture previews, or wearable accessories.

2. Scene Setup

Design your scene with modular components (e.g., wheels, body, interior for a car).

Organize assets logically to allow dynamic updates.

Use lighting that enhances product appearance (e.g., studio lighting setups).


3. UI Integration

Use HTML/CSS or PlayCanvas UI libraries to build controls (dropdowns, swatches, sliders).

Bind UI events to component updates:

colorPicker.on('change', (value) => {
  material.diffuse.set(...value);
  material.update();
});


4. Dynamic Materials and Assets

Swap textures and materials at runtime using PlayCanvas asset system.

For performance, preload all necessary assets.

Use variants or asset bundles for optimized loading.


5. Performance Optimization

Limit real-time lights and shadows.

Compress textures appropriately.

Use LODs (Level of Detail) if needed for complex models.


6. Exporting Configurations

Store user selections in JSON:

{
  "bodyColor": "#ff0000",
  "wheelType": "sport",
  "interior": "leather"
}

Allow screenshots or AR previews if needed (via WebXR or image capture).
