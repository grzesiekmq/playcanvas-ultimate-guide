Chapter 43 â€“ Post-Processing Effects

Post-processing effects are essential tools to enhance the visual quality of your PlayCanvas scenes. They allow you to apply various filters and effects after the scene has been rendered, creating atmosphere, mood, or stylistic flair.

1. Common Post-Processing Effects

Bloom: Adds glow to bright areas, simulating light scattering.

Color Grading: Adjusts color tones for artistic effects.

Depth of Field: Simulates camera focus by blurring objects outside the focal range.

Motion Blur: Adds blur to moving objects, enhancing realism in motion.

Ambient Occlusion: Enhances shadows in crevices and corners for more depth.


2. Implementing Post-Processing in PlayCanvas

PlayCanvas provides a flexible post-processing framework that lets you chain multiple effects. You can enable effects in the editor or via script using the pc.PostEffect class.

3. Performance Tips

Use post-processing effects sparingly, especially on mobile devices.

Adjust quality settings based on the target hardware.

Profile your scene to ensure post effects do not bottleneck performance.
