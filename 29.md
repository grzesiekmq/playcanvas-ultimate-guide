Chapter 29: Post-Processing Effects

Post-processing effects in PlayCanvas allow developers to enhance the visual fidelity of their scenes by applying full-screen filters after the main rendering pass. These effects are useful for achieving cinematic looks, visual polish, and stylistic touches.


---

29.1 Overview

Post-processing involves capturing the screen output, running it through shaders (often called “fullscreen passes”), and rendering the modified image back onto a quad or directly to the screen. Common effects include:

Bloom

Color grading

Depth of field

Tone mapping

Vignette

Chromatic aberration

FXAA (anti-aliasing)



---

29.2 Enabling Post Effects

In PlayCanvas, post-processing is applied via scripts using the pc.PostEffect system. First, include the script for the desired effect, either by writing a custom shader or using built-in effects from the PlayCanvas GitHub repository.

To activate post-processing:

1. Attach a script to a camera entity.


2. Use a pc.PostEffectQueue and add desired effects.



Example:

this.post = new pc.PostEffectQueue(this.app.graphicsDevice);
this.post.addEffect(new pc.BloomEffect(graphicsDevice));
this.app.scene.layers.getLayerByName("PostLayer").addCamera(this.entity.camera);


---

29.3 Using Built-in Effects

PlayCanvas maintains post-processing samples and scripts. You can import them into your project and configure them via script attributes.

Example Bloom effect:

this.bloom = new pc.BloomEffect(graphicsDevice);
this.bloom.threshold = 0.8;
this.bloom.intensity = 0.5;
this.post.addEffect(this.bloom);


---

29.4 Writing a Custom Effect

To write your own:

var MyEffect = pc.createScript('myEffect');

MyEffect.prototype.initialize = function() {
    var graphicsDevice = this.app.graphicsDevice;

    this.effect = new pc.PostEffect(graphicsDevice);
    this.effect.shader = new pc.Shader(graphicsDevice, {
        attributes: {
            aPosition: pc.SEMANTIC_POSITION
        },
        vshader: /* GLSL Vertex Shader */,
        fshader: /* GLSL Fragment Shader */
    });

    this.effect.render = function(inputTarget, outputTarget, rect) {
        graphicsDevice.setRenderTarget(outputTarget);
        graphicsDevice.updateBegin();
        graphicsDevice.setShader(this.shader);
        // render fullscreen quad...
    };

    this.entity.camera.postEffects.addEffect(this.effect);
};

Custom shaders allow you to simulate lens effects, screen-space outlines, or stylized filters like pixelation or sepia.

29.5 Tone Mapping & HDR

Tone mapping converts HDR output to a displayable LDR range.

PlayCanvas supports several tone mapping algorithms:

Linear

ACES

Filmic

Hejl


You can configure tone mapping via app.scene.toneMapping:

app.scene.toneMapping = pc.TONEMAP_ACES;

Enable HDR rendering with:

cameraEntity.camera.enableHDR = true;


---

29.6 FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing)

FXAA is a cheap screen-space anti-aliasing technique:

var fxaa = new pc.FxaaEffect(graphicsDevice);
post.addEffect(fxaa);

It’s efficient for reducing jagged edges without heavy performance cost.


---

29.7 Combining Multiple Effects

You can chain effects in a specific order:

post.addEffect(colorGrading);
post.addEffect(bloom);
post.addEffect(vignette);

Order matters — for example, applying bloom after color grading will yield different results than the reverse.


---

29.8 Managing Performance

Don’t apply more than 2–3 effects on low-end devices.

Disable effects when not visible (e.g. paused game).

Consider toggling effects based on quality settings.


Use device.maxTextureSize and device.supportsFloat32Textures to adaptively enable effects.


---

29.9 Debugging Effects

Use render targets to preview intermediate passes. In custom effects, output debug color:

gl_FragColor = vec4(texColor.rgb, 1.0); // unmodified

Or use overlays to visualize effect intensity or thresholds.


---

29.10 Practical Example: Filmic Look

Chain the following:

Tone mapping: ACES

Color grading LUT

Bloom

Vignette

Chromatic aberration


Combined, these can simulate a high-quality, stylized post-film look similar to AAA games.
