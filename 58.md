Chapter 58 – Building AR Apps with PlayCanvas and WebXR

While Virtual Reality immerses users in a fully digital world, Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital content onto the real world. Using WebXR’s AR capabilities, PlayCanvas enables browser-based AR applications that run on compatible devices like Android phones with Chrome or HoloLens.

1. What You Need for WebXR AR

Before starting:

You need a WebXR-compatible device with AR capabilities (e.g., Android with Chrome)

Enable webxr and webxr-incubations flags in Chrome (if necessary)

HTTPS hosting is mandatory for WebXR AR sessions



---

2. Enabling AR in PlayCanvas

Basic AR flow:

if (this.app.xr.supported) {
    this.app.xr.start(pc.XRTYPE_AR, pc.XRSPACE_LOCAL);
}

The pc.XRTYPE_AR flag starts an immersive-ar session.

XRSPACE_LOCAL ties virtual content to the physical environment.

Requires xr-camera on the main camera entity.



---

3. Understanding AR Anchoring

Since there's no controller or keyboard in mobile AR:

Place content based on world hit tests (e.g., detect floor or walls)

Use camera pose for anchoring objects relative to the real world



---

4. Hit Testing in AR

Hit tests allow placing objects on real-world surfaces.

this.app.xr.session.requestReferenceSpace('viewer').then((viewerSpace) => {
    this.viewerSpace = viewerSpace;
    this.hitTestSource = this.app.xr.session.requestHitTestSource({ space: viewerSpace });
});

In the update loop:

const frame = this.app.xr.frame;
const hitTestResults = frame.getHitTestResults(this.hitTestSource);

If hit results exist, you can position your entity:

const pose = hitTestResults[0].getPose(this.app.xr.referenceSpace);
entity.setPosition(pose.transform.position.x, pose.transform.position.y, pose.transform.position.z);


---

5. Rendering Virtual Content

Rendering in AR is different:

The camera feed becomes the background

Only your 3D content is rendered on top


Avoid large opaque backgrounds or skyboxes—use transparent environments.


---

6. UI/UX Considerations for AR

AR has its own design constraints:

UI must not block the camera view

Use reticles or gaze-based selection

Keep UI floating or anchored near the camera


Reticle example: A circular reticle in front of the user indicating where a tap would place a 3D object.


---

7. Placing Objects via Tap

To make interactions easier, tie object placement to screen taps:

this.app.mouse.on('mousedown', () => {
    if (this.latestHitPose) {
        const obj = createARObject();
        obj.setPosition(this.latestHitPose.transform.position);
    }
});


---

8. Light Estimation and Shadows

WebXR supports light estimation on some devices, letting you adjust the lighting of your virtual object to match the environment. (Still experimental.)

Shadow tips:

Use baked ambient shadows (e.g., a transparent plane with soft shadows)

Refrain from using real-time dynamic shadows—they're costly and often unsupported



---

9. Performance Considerations

Reduce draw calls and shader complexity

Use GPU-friendly materials

Load assets asynchronously

Avoid large model files



---

10. Deployment and Browser Support

WebXR AR works in:

Chrome on Android (with correct flags)

HoloLens via Edge

Not supported on iOS (use WebKit+ARKit workarounds like 8thWall)


Deployment: Just like any PlayCanvas project. Use secure HTTPS hosting.


---

Summary: PlayCanvas + WebXR empowers developers to create native-feeling AR experiences right in the browser. From surface detection to real-time interaction, you can bridge the real and digital worlds with relatively simple code.
