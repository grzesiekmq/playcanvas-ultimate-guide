Chapter 14: Animation in PlayCanvas

Animation brings your game world to life. In PlayCanvas, animation is handled through dedicated components, imported assets, and runtime blending. This chapter explores everything from keyframe playback to procedural animation.


---

14.1 Animation Components

PlayCanvas uses two primary components for animation:

animation: Legacy component (simple playback)

anim: Modern component (state graph-based)


Prefer the anim component for advanced workflows.


---

14.2 Importing Animations

When importing a .glb or .fbx file with animations:

Animations are auto-detected and split into animation tracks.

PlayCanvas supports skeletal animation and morph targets.


The asset will include an Animation resource which you can assign to an entity with an anim component.


---

14.3 Using the Anim Component

The anim component lets you build animation state graphs.

Basic usage:

entity.addComponent('anim', {
    activate: true
});
entity.anim.assignAnimation('Idle', idleAnimationAsset.resource);
entity.anim.assignAnimation('Run', runAnimationAsset.resource);

Then build a state graph with transitions (via Editor or JSON).


---

14.4 Scripting State Changes

Control state changes via script:

if (this.app.keyboard.isPressed(pc.KEY_W)) {
    this.entity.anim.setBoolean('moving', true);
} else {
    this.entity.anim.setBoolean('moving', false);
}

Conditions for transitions are configured in the animation state graph.


---

14.5 Events in Animations

Add named events to animation timelines to trigger logic mid-animation:

this.entity.anim.on('footstep', function () {
    this.app.fire('play:footstepSound');
});

Attach these via the animation asset or Editor.


---

14.6 Legacy Animation Component

The animation component is simpler, supporting only one clip at a time.

entity.animation.play('Run');

It is suitable for basic use cases or when scripting full control manually.


---

14.7 Blending Between States

PlayCanvas allows blending between animations:

entity.anim.baseLayer.transition('Idle', 'Run', 0.3);

Set transition durations in the state graph or via code.


---

14.8 Procedural Animation

Combine animations with real-time movement or physics:

Blend animations based on movement speed.

Use IK or constraints via third-party libraries.

Combine skeletal animation with bone-driven code for head tracking, aiming, etc.



---

14.9 Performance Tips

Use compressed animation assets (via GLB or FBX).

Keep bone counts reasonable for mobile.

Bake animations into keyframes when possible.



---

14.10 Debugging Animation

Use the Animation Graph Inspector in Editor.

Visualize states, transitions, parameters in real-time.

Print current state: entity.anim.baseLayer.activeState.

Next Chapter: Chapter 15 covers UI system in PlayCanvas â€” screen space elements, anchors, responsive design, and script-driven interaction.
