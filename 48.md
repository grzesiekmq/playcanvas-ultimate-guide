Chapter 48 â€“ Scripting Patterns and Best Practices

Writing clean, maintainable scripts is vital for scalable PlayCanvas projects. This chapter dives into effective scripting patterns and tips.

1. Component-Based Architecture

Organize functionality into reusable components attached to entities.

Keep components focused and single-responsibility.


2. Event-Driven Programming

Use PlayCanvas event system (this.app.on, this.entity.fire) to decouple components.

Avoid tight coupling by relying on events for communication.


3. Modular Code

Separate code into modules and classes to improve clarity and reuse.

Use ES6 modules or namespaces.


4. Performance Considerations

Avoid heavy computations in update loops; cache values where possible.

Use requestAnimationFrame wisely and throttle expensive tasks.

Profile scripts regularly.
