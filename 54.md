Chapter 54 – Matchmaking and Lobby Systems

In this chapter, we focus on designing and implementing matchmaking and lobby systems in PlayCanvas-based multiplayer games. These systems are essential for managing players before they enter a game session.


---

1. Lobby vs Matchmaking

Lobby system: Players join or create rooms manually.

Matchmaking: The server automatically matches players based on criteria (e.g., skill, region, preferences).


Both systems serve the purpose of organizing players into manageable game sessions before actual gameplay.


---

2. Creating a Simple Lobby

A lobby can be represented as a list of available rooms:

Server (Node.js WebSocket):

let rooms = [];

function createRoom(name, hostId) {
    const room = { id: generateId(), name, players: [hostId] };
    rooms.push(room);
    return room;
}

Client (PlayCanvas):

socket.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'createRoom', name: 'FunRoom' }));

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.type === 'roomCreated') {
        displayRoomUI(data.room);
    }
};


---

3. Joining and Leaving Rooms

Players can browse and join lobbies via UI.

Client:

function joinRoom(roomId) {
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'joinRoom', roomId }));
}

Server:

function joinRoom(playerId, roomId) {
    const room = rooms.find(r => r.id === roomId);
    if (room) room.players.push(playerId);
}


---

4. Broadcasting Lobby Updates

All clients should receive real-time lobby state updates:

function broadcastLobby() {
    const state = JSON.stringify({ type: 'lobbyUpdate', rooms });
    wss.clients.forEach(client => client.send(state));
}


---

5. Starting the Game

When the host is ready:

socket.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'startGame', roomId }));

// Server responds:
broadcastToRoom(roomId, { type: 'gameStart' });

Clients then load the game scene and begin synchronized gameplay.


---

6. Handling Disconnections

Make sure to clean up empty rooms and remove disconnected players:

ws.on('close', () => {
    removePlayerFromRooms(ws.id);
});

If the host leaves, assign a new host or disband the room.


---

7. Matchmaking Based on Criteria

To automate room assignment:

Assign players to existing rooms if they meet criteria

Otherwise, create a new room


function autoMatch(player) {
    let match = rooms.find(r => r.players.length < 4);
    if (!match) match = createRoom('Auto', player.id);
    joinRoom(player.id, match.id);
}

Add filtering based on:

Region (latency)

Game mode

Player rating (ELO/MMR)



---

8. Frontend Lobby UI in PlayCanvas

Use DOM or 3D UI to show available lobbies:

const lobbyList = document.getElementById('lobbies');
function updateLobbyUI(rooms) {
    lobbyList.innerHTML = '';
    rooms.forEach(room => {
        const item = document.createElement('div');
        item.textContent = room.name;
        item.onclick = () => joinRoom(room.id);
        lobbyList.appendChild(item);
    });
}


---

9. Handling Player Limits

Limit players per room (e.g., 2–4):

if (room.players.length >= room.maxPlayers) {
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'error', message: 'Room full' }));
    return;
}

Show this info in the lobby list UI.


---

10. Optional Features

Room passwords or private flags

Chat within lobby

Ready system before starting

Room settings customization



---

A solid lobby and matchmaking system makes your multiplayer game feel polished and professional. In the next chapter, we’ll build on this with Chapter 55 – Real-Time Communication and Voice Chat Integration.
