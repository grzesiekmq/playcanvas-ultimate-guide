Chapter 17: Particle Systems in PlayCanvas

Particle systems allow you to simulate effects like smoke, fire, explosions, sparks, rain, and magic spells. In PlayCanvas, the built-in ParticleSystemComponent provides a flexible and powerful way to create these visual effects with minimal performance cost.

17.1 Overview of Particle Systems

A particle system emits small, short-lived visual elements (particles) from one or more emitters. Each particle has properties like lifetime, velocity, size, color, and opacity. These properties can be animated or randomized to achieve natural or stylized effects.


---

17.2 Adding a Particle System

To add a particle system:

1. Create a new entity in the hierarchy.


2. Add the particlesystem component.


3. Assign a particle texture (e.g., a small smoke sprite).


4. Configure emission, lifetime, velocity, color, and other parameters.



Alternatively, create it via script:

entity.addComponent('particlesystem', {
    numParticles: 100,
    lifetime: 1,
    rate: 0.1,
    colorGraph: new pc.ColorCurve([pc.Color.WHITE, pc.Color.GRAY]),
    velocityGraph: new pc.Curve([1.0, 0.5]),
    scaleGraph: new pc.Curve([0.5, 1.0]),
    looping: true
});


---

17.3 Particle Texture

Use a small, semi-transparent texture for particles (e.g., circle, puff, glow). Upload it to your assets, then assign it in the particle system's colorMap field. Transparent PNGs work well.


---

17.4 Emission Settings

Key emission properties:

rate: how often particles are emitted per second.

lifetime: how long each particle lasts.

emitterExtents: controls the 3D bounds of emission.

emitterShape: choose from box, sphere, or cone.


You can randomize start angles and directions for dynamic effects.


---

17.5 Particle Properties

Customize particle appearance over time using graphs (curves or color gradients):

ColorGraph: fade from bright to transparent.

ScaleGraph: particles grow or shrink.

VelocityGraph: speed varies over time.

RotationGraph: adds swirling or spiraling motion.


Graphs can be defined in the editor or in code with pc.Curve.


---

17.6 Particle Animation

While PlayCanvas doesnâ€™t support animated sprite sheets for particles out of the box, you can simulate animation by:

Using animated alpha/fade via colorGraph.

Blending textures dynamically by swapping particle materials (advanced).

Using billboarding for 2D effects that always face the camera.



---

17.7 World vs Local Space

Particle systems can emit particles in local or world space:

Local: particles move with the emitter (good for exhaust, fire on moving object).

World: particles stay in place when emitter moves (useful for explosions).


Set in the localSpace property:

entity.particlesystem.localSpace = false;


---

17.8 Looping and One-Shot Effects

You can create:

Looping effects (like rain, smoke): set looping: true.

One-shot effects (like explosion): set looping: false, trigger manually:


entity.particlesystem.reset();


---

17.9 Controlling Particle Systems via Script

You can control systems dynamically:

this.entity.particlesystem.play();
this.entity.particlesystem.stop();
this.entity.particlesystem.reset();

You can also change parameters at runtime:

this.entity.particlesystem.rate = 5;

17.10 Best Practices

Keep particle count low for performance.

Use additive or alpha blend modes for better visuals.

Bake animations into textures where possible.

Group similar effects under one parent for easy scene management.

Avoid GPU overdraw from excessive overlapping transparent particles.
