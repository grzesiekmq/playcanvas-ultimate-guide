Chapter 24: Animation

Animation in PlayCanvas breathes life into your 3D models—whether you're animating a walking character, a rotating door, or UI elements. PlayCanvas offers a powerful animation system that supports both imported animations (e.g., from GLTF/FBX) and runtime control via scripting.


---

24.1 Importing Animations

You can import animated models using the GLB or FBX format. When you import:

GLB/GLTF: Stores mesh, skeleton, animations, and materials.

FBX: Requires conversion via PlayCanvas Editor or glTF pipeline.


The imported file will contain:

A model or entity hierarchy

One or more animation tracks

An Animation asset



---

24.2 The Animation Component

To play animations on an entity:

entity.addComponent('animation', {
    assets: [ app.assets.find('Idle') ],
    activate: true,
    loop: true,
    speed: 1
});

You can switch animations like so:

entity.animation.play('Run', 0.2);

Where 'Run' is the name of the animation track.


---

24.3 Animation Blending

To create smooth transitions between animations, use blending:

entity.animation.play('Walk', 0.3); // 0.3 seconds blend

Blending is especially useful for character controllers (e.g., idle → walk → run).


---

24.4 Animation Events

Animation tracks can contain custom animation events, which trigger functions at specific keyframes.

entity.animation.on('eventName', function () {
    console.log('Animation event fired!');
});

Add events using a 3D tool (e.g., Blender) or the PlayCanvas Editor.


---

24.5 Using AnimStateGraph

PlayCanvas supports animation state graphs for managing complex logic visually, including:

States (Idle, Walk, Run)

Transitions (with conditions)

Parameters (bool, int, float, trigger)


Workflow:

1. Create a state graph asset.


2. Add an anim component to an entity.


3. Assign the graph and bind animations.


4. Modify parameters via code:



entity.anim.setBoolean('isWalking', true);
entity.anim.setTrigger('jump');


---

24.6 Scripting Dynamic Animation

You can fully control animation through script logic:

if (speed > 0.1) {
    entity.animation.play('Run');
} else {
    entity.animation.play('Idle');
}

Or tie animations to gameplay events, timers, or user input.


---

24.7 Skeletons and Skinned Meshes

Skinned meshes are animated via a skeleton (bone hierarchy). You can:

Access bones via model.meshInstances

Control individual bones (e.g., for IK or aiming):


let bone = entity.model.model.graph.findByName('Head');
bone.setLocalEulerAngles(0, 45, 0);

Note: This overrides animation unless you re-blend or manually animate the bone.


---

24.8 Retargeting Animations

If multiple characters share a skeleton structure, you can reuse animations across models. Make sure the bone names and hierarchy match.

PlayCanvas does not offer built-in retargeting; prepare compatible rigs during asset creation (in Blender, Maya, etc.).


---

24.9 Root Motion

Animations can move the character forward (e.g., walking forward). You can:

Enable root motion: Let animation drive movement.

Disable root motion: Drive position manually in script.


PlayCanvas doesn’t extract root motion automatically. You must manage it via scripting or blend both movement types.


---

24.10 Optimizing Animations

Tips for performance:

Limit animation track length and resolution.

Reuse animation assets when possible.

Use blending instead of layered animations.

Disable anim component when not needed.
