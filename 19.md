Chapter 19: User Interface (UI) Components

Creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces is crucial for any interactive application or game. PlayCanvas offers a 2D screen space UI system that allows you to design HUDs, menus, dialogs, and other overlays using entities, components, and assets.

19.1 The Screen Component

The screen component defines a 2D UI layer. It ensures that child elements behave like traditional UI:

Anchored to screen resolution

Pixel-perfect rendering

Works independently from 3D world space


To set up a UI screen:

1. Add a new Entity named UI.


2. Add a Screen component.


3. Set Screen Space to true.


4. Choose a resolution (e.g., 1920×1080 for full HD).


5. Add child elements (buttons, text, images).

19.2 UI Elements: Image, Text, Button

PlayCanvas provides several built-in UI components:

Element: Image – displays textures (e.g., logos, icons).

Element: Text – renders UI text (e.g., labels, scores).

Element: Button – combines image + text + interactive behavior.


Each element can be customized:

Anchors (e.g., top-left, center)

Margins and offsets

Opacity and color

Font size and alignment


Example: A centered "Start" button:

{
  "type": "element",
  "element": {
    "type": "button",
    "anchor": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    "pivot": [0.5, 0.5],
    "text": "Start",
    "fontSize": 48
  }
}

19.3 UI Scripting Basics

Interactivity is defined via scripts attached to buttons or UI elements.

A common use case: reacting to a button click:

// ui-button.js
pc.script.create('uiButton', function (app) {
    return {
        initialize: function () {
            this.entity.element.on('click', function () {
                console.log('Button clicked');
            }, this);
        }
    };
});

Attach this script to a button entity.


---

19.4 Responsive Layout

To make UI elements adaptive:

Use anchors relative to screen edges or corners.

Avoid fixed pixel positions if targeting multiple resolutions.

Consider aspect ratio logic if UI must adapt on portrait/landscape devices.


For example:

this.entity.element.anchor = [0, 1, 0, 1]; // Top-left corner


---

19.5 UI Events

UI components emit standard events:

click

mouseenter

mouseleave

mousedown

mouseup


Each can be used to provide feedback (e.g., hover effects, sounds, tooltips).

Example:

this.entity.element.on('mouseenter', () => {
    this.entity.element.color = new pc.Color(1, 0.8, 0.8); // highlight
});


---

19.6 Input Fields

You can create text inputs for forms, chat, or login UIs.

1. Add a TextElement.


2. Enable the Input Field toggle in the Inspector.


3. Optionally define placeholder, maxLength, and password mode.


4. Use the change event:



this.entity.element.on('change', function (value) {
    console.log('New input:', value);
}, this);


---

19.7 Combining UI with Game Logic

UI elements can trigger game state changes:

Start/pause/resume

Upgrade skills

Open inventory

Quit to main menu


Use app.fire() or event systems to integrate UI events with gameplay scripts.

Example:

this.entity.element.on('click', () => {
    this.app.fire('game:start');
});

Then listen in your game manager script:

this.app.on('game:start', function () {
    // Start gameplay
});


---

19.8 Styling and Themes

Though PlayCanvas UI is primarily functional, you can customize it with:

Textures (9-slice, scalable)

Custom fonts (TTF)

Font sizes and colors

Visual effects (hover animations via scripts)


You can even build a theme system in code to allow skin switching at runtime.


---

19.9 Performance Considerations

UI updates every frame – minimize per-frame layout changes.

Limit the number of active element components.

Avoid deep hierarchy trees (flatten where possible).

Use batching where appropriate.



---

19.10 Alternatives and Extensions

For more complex UI needs:

Use HTML/CSS overlays via iframe or DOMElement approach.

Integrate with external UI libraries using WebGL overlay tricks.

Consider PlayCanvas plugins or community frameworks (e.g., UI Kit).
