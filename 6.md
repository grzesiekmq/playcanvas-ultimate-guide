Chapter 6: Asset Management in PlayCanvas

Asset management is fundamental in PlayCanvas for loading and organizing models, textures, sounds, scripts, and other resources. A well-structured asset pipeline ensures smooth development and optimized performance.


---

6.1 Asset Registry

PlayCanvas applications maintain a central Asset Registry. Assets are globally available through app.assets.

Basic usage:

const texture = app.assets.find('MyTexture', 'texture');

To load an asset dynamically:

app.assets.load(texture);

You can also access an asset by its ID:

const asset = app.assets.get(12345678);


---

6.2 Asset Types

Common asset types include:

'model'

'texture'

'material'

'script'

'audio'

'json'

'font'

'shader'

'cubemap'


Each type has its loader and usage pattern. For example, texture.resource gives you a pc.Texture.


---

6.3 Asset Loading Events

Assets emit events that you can hook into:

asset.ready(function () {
    // Use asset.resource
});

app.assets.load(asset);

This is critical for ensuring assets are used only after loading completes.


---

6.4 Preloading vs Streaming

PlayCanvas supports preloading and streaming assets:

Preloading ensures an asset is available before the app starts.

Streaming loads the asset only when needed.


You can configure this in the Editor or set asset.preload = false in code.


---

6.5 Using JSON Assets

JSON assets are useful for storing configuration, game data, or procedural definitions.

const data = asset.resource;
console.log(data.enemySpawnRate);

You can create custom JSON assets and use them like static config files.


---

6.6 Organizing Assets

Best practices for asset organization:

Use folders in the editor for logical grouping.

Name assets consistently and descriptively.

Use tags to group similar assets (e.g., UI, enemy, level1).



---

6.7 Dynamic Asset Creation

You can create assets at runtime:

const material = new pc.StandardMaterial();
const matAsset = new pc.Asset('DynamicMat', 'material', {});

matAsset.resource = material;
app.assets.add(matAsset);

This is useful for procedural content or runtime customizations.


---

6.8 Bundling and Compression

PlayCanvas supports asset bundles (via the REST API or editor export) and compression strategies such as:

Texture compression (DDS, KTX)

Audio compression (MP3, OGG)

Model compression (DRACO, GLB)


Use compression tools before uploading to optimize load times.


---

6.9 Asset Referencing in Scripts

Access assets by script attributes:

MyScript.attributes.add('myTexture', {
    type: 'asset',
    assetType: 'texture'
});

this.entity.model.material.diffuseMap = this.myTexture.resource;

The Editor injects selected assets automatically into these attributes.


---

6.10 Best Practices

Preload only essential assets; stream the rest.

Avoid asset duplication by referencing shared resources.

Use meaningful names and version control for critical assets.

Minimize runtime changes to critical assets for performance.
