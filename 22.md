Chapter 22: Lighting Techniques

Lighting is fundamental to defining the visual atmosphere and realism of a 3D scene. In PlayCanvas, lighting is flexible and performant, supporting a variety of real-time and baked approaches. Understanding how to use lights effectively can dramatically enhance the look and performance of your project.

22.1 Light Types in PlayCanvas

PlayCanvas supports three types of real-time lights:

Directional Light: Simulates sunlight or moonlight. Infinite distance and parallel rays.

Point Light: Emits light in all directions from a single point.

Spot Light: Emits a cone of light in a specific direction.


Each light type supports properties such as color, intensity, range, and shadow casting.

let light = new pc.Entity();
light.addComponent("light", {
    type: "directional",
    color: new pc.Color(1, 1, 0.9),
    intensity: 1.5,
    castShadows: true
});


---

22.2 Lighting and Materials

Materials interact with light based on their properties:

Metalness and Roughness: Control how reflective or diffuse a surface appears.

Normal Maps: Affect how light bounces to simulate surface detail.

Ambient Occlusion: Adds contact shadows and improves depth perception.


The Standard Material system handles all these automatically with physically-based rendering (PBR).


---

22.3 Shadow Mapping

Real-time shadows are supported for all light types.

Directional Shadows use cascaded shadow maps.

Point Lights use cubemap-based shadows.

Spot Lights use a single shadow map.


Tweak shadow parameters:

resolution: Higher values = sharper shadows.

distance: Maximum visible shadow range.

bias and normalOffsetBias: Reduce shadow acne.


light.light.shadowDistance = 50;
light.light.shadowBias = 0.05;


---

22.4 Ambient Light and Skybox

Ambient light fills the scene with indirect light.

Adjusted via scene.ambientLight.

Can be flat color or driven by a skybox.


Skyboxes serve both as background and a source of lighting via Image-Based Lighting (IBL).

app.scene.ambientLight = new pc.Color(0.2, 0.2, 0.2);


---

22.5 Light Cookies

Light cookies are textures projected by a light, simulating patterns like window blinds or tree leaves.

Only supported by spot and directional lights.

light.light.cookie = asset.resource;
light.light.cookieIntensity = 1;

Cookies must be square power-of-two grayscale images.


---

22.6 Baked Lighting

Baking lights into textures reduces performance cost:

Use lightmaps to store lighting information per surface.

Ideal for static environments.

Requires proper UV2 setup.


Workflow:

1. Add lightmap-ready materials.


2. Enable light baking in editor.


3. Bake via the PlayCanvas Editor (Editor → Scene Settings → Bake Lighting).




---

22.7 Light Falloff and Attenuation

Point and spot lights use attenuation to simulate brightness falloff over distance.

PlayCanvas supports physical falloff:

Quadratic by default.

Use falloffMode: pc.LIGHTFALLOFF_LINEAR to customize.


light.light.falloffMode = pc.LIGHTFALLOFF_LINEAR;
light.light.range = 15;


---

22.8 Performance Considerations

Minimize the number of shadow-casting lights.

Use baked lighting where possible.

Disable shadows on mobile when not needed.

Use LODs and batching for large scenes.



---

22.9 Light Probes and Reflection Probes

Reflection probes capture environment maps for accurate reflections on shiny surfaces. These are static and must be baked.

Use pc.Entity with render + reflectionProbe.

Ideal for indoor scenes with multiple reflective surfaces.



---

22.10 Debugging and Optimization

Use the PlayCanvas profiler (F12) and Scene Stats to:

Track number of active lights.

Monitor draw calls.

Identify shadow map resolutions and GPU load.
