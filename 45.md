Chapter 45 â€“ Animation Systems and Optimization

Animations breathe life into your PlayCanvas scenes, making characters and objects dynamic and engaging. Efficient animation management is key to maintain performance.

1. Animation Types Supported

Skeletal Animation: Bone-driven deformation of meshes for characters.

Morph Targets: Vertex-based animation for facial expressions and shape changes.

Sprite Animation: Frame-by-frame animations for 2D elements or billboards.


2. Importing and Setting Up Animations

Use FBX or glTF formats supporting embedded animations.

Assign animation clips to entities and control playback via scripts.


3. Animation Blending and State Machines

Blend multiple animations smoothly for natural transitions.

Use PlayCanvas animation state machine for complex behavior control.


4. Optimization Strategies

Limit the number of active animated characters.

Use Level of Detail (LOD) for animations, reducing update frequency on distant objects.

Cache animation data and reuse clips when possible.
