Chapter 12: User Interface (UI) in PlayCanvas

User interface (UI) is essential for communicating with the player — whether it’s menus, HUDs, or notifications. PlayCanvas provides built-in support for creating 2D screen-space UIs that integrate seamlessly with the 3D world.

12.1 UI System Overview

PlayCanvas uses Screen and Element components to create 2D UI layouts. These are rendered in screen space or world space depending on configuration.

Screen Component: Defines the root of a UI hierarchy.

Element Component: Defines a visual UI element (e.g., image, text, button).

12.2 Setting Up a UI

1. Create an empty entity.


2. Add a screen component to it:



entity.addComponent('screen', {
    referenceResolution: new pc.Vec2(1280, 720),
    screenSpace: true
});

3. Add child entities with element components.

12.3 Element Component Types

The Element component supports:

Image: Displays sprites or textures.

Text: Renders text.

Group: Used for layout.

Button: Combines images + events.


Example: A simple text label

label.addComponent('element', {
    type: 'text',
    text: 'Hello Player!',
    fontSize: 32,
    color: [1, 1, 1]
});


---

12.4 Anchors and Pivot

Use anchors to define how UI elements stretch or attach to parts of the screen.

(0, 0) = bottom-left

(0.5, 0.5) = center

(1, 1) = top-right


Pivot determines the element’s local origin for scaling and positioning.


---

12.5 UI Layout with Groups

Use element components of type group to arrange child elements using:

layoutType: 'horizontal', 'vertical', or 'none'

spacing: spacing between elements

alignment: alignment rules


Great for menus and option lists.


---

12.6 Interactivity with Buttons

To respond to UI events:

1. Create a button (an image + child text).


2. Add a script to handle events:



this.entity.button.on('click', function (event) {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
}, this);

Make sure the script component is on the same entity.


---

12.7 UI in World Space

Want 3D menus or labels above objects?

Set screenSpace: false on the Screen component.

Position the screen entity like any 3D object.


Perfect for name tags, in-world buttons, etc.


---

12.8 Best Practices

Use consistent reference resolution (e.g., 1280x720).

Minimize per-frame text changes (they are expensive).

Group UI logic into separate scripts from 3D logic.
