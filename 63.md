Chapter 63 – Procedural Content Generation in PlayCanvas

Procedural generation (PCG) is a powerful technique for creating dynamic, varied content using algorithms instead of manually authored data. Whether it's terrain, levels, textures, or geometry, PlayCanvas offers the flexibility and API access to generate and manipulate objects at runtime.


---

1. What Is Procedural Content Generation?

PCG refers to algorithms that create data — often randomized or algorithmically driven, such as:

Random terrain

Infinite levels

Maze generation

Cloud and foliage systems

Texture synthesis

City or dungeon layouts


Benefits include:

Reduced file sizes

Infinite variation

Replayability

Efficient use of developer time



---

2. Randomness and Noise

A good PCG system balances randomness with structure. Tools used include:

Math.random() for simple randomness

Perlin or Simplex noise for smooth variation (useful for terrain, clouds, textures)

Hash-based noise for repeatability


In JavaScript:

const seed = 42;
Math.seedrandom(seed); // optional library for deterministic results

For Perlin noise: use libraries like perlin-noise or custom GLSL noise functions.


---

3. Procedural Geometry Generation

You can generate meshes procedurally using pc.createMesh():

const positions = [ /* x, y, z... */ ];
const indices = [ /* triangle indices */ ];
const normals = [ /* normal vectors */ ];

const mesh = pc.createMesh(app.graphicsDevice, positions, {
    normals: normals,
    indices: indices
});

Attach to an entity:

const model = new pc.Entity();
model.addComponent("render", { type: "asset" });
model.render.meshInstances[0].mesh = mesh;

Useful for:

Caves

Roads

Trees

Furniture

Buildings



---

4. Maze and Dungeon Algorithms

Maze generation can be done using:

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm

Cellular Automata (for caves)


Example (grid-based):

const maze = [];
for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
  maze[y] = [];
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
    maze[y][x] = Math.random() > 0.8 ? 1 : 0; // wall or floor
  }
}

Render walls with cubes:

if (maze[y][x] === 1) {
  const wall = new pc.Entity();
  wall.addComponent("model", { type: "box" });
  wall.setPosition(x, 0, y);
  app.root.addChild(wall);
}


---

5. Procedural Terrain Generation

Terrain via heightmap or noise:

const size = 64;
for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
  for (let z = 0; z < size; z++) {
    const y = noise.perlin2(x / 10, z / 10) * 5;
    createVoxel(x, y, z);
  }
}

Or generate a heightmap plane with vertex displacement.


---

6. Runtime Texture Synthesis

Procedurally generate images for:

Cloud maps

Star fields

Terrain splatmaps

Stylized backgrounds


Use pc.Texture:

const texture = new pc.Texture(graphicsDevice, {
  width: 256,
  height: 256,
  format: pc.PIXELFORMAT_R8_G8_B8
});

const pixels = new Uint8Array(256 * 256 * 3);
for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i++) {
  pixels[i] = Math.random() * 255;
}

texture.lock().set(pixels);
texture.unlock();


---

7. Combining Modular Systems

PCG works best with modular logic:

Generate map → layout → spawn items → decorate

Use blueprints for prefabs (e.g., room types)

Attach metadata (tags, weights, probabilities)


This allows reusability and dynamic content injection.


---

8. Saving and Sharing Procedural Worlds

You can:

Serialize generated data to JSON

Store in localStorage or cloud

Regenerate based on seed input


const levelData = JSON.stringify(maze);
localStorage.setItem("level-1", levelData);


---

9. Common Pitfalls

Over-randomization: results may feel meaningless

Lack of constraints: content must follow gameplay rules

Performance: large generated scenes can slow down mobile devices


Use batching and pooling to optimize.


---

10. Use Cases in PlayCanvas

Procedural generation shines in:

Roguelike games

Infinite runners

Puzzle games

Sandbox simulators

Background generation

Stylized art games



---

Summary

Procedural content generation opens creative and technical doors. With PlayCanvas’s flexible scripting and WebGL pipeline, you can generate worlds, terrain, textures, and full levels on the fly — making every playthrough feel fresh and unique.
