Chapter 11: Physics Integration in PlayCanvas

PlayCanvas includes a powerful physics engine powered by Ammo.js, enabling realistic simulation of collisions, rigid bodies, gravity, and constraints. Understanding how to integrate physics will greatly improve your game’s realism and interactivity.

11.1 Enabling Physics in a Project

Before using physics features, make sure the physics settings are enabled in your PlayCanvas project. Ammo.js must be loaded, which is done automatically in the Editor when using physics components.


---

11.2 Rigid Body Component

The RigidBodyComponent defines how an entity behaves physically.

Key properties:

type: 'static', 'dynamic', or 'kinematic'

mass: Used only if type is 'dynamic'

friction, restitution: Define surface behavior


Example:

entity.addComponent('rigidbody', {
    type: 'dynamic',
    mass: 1,
    friction: 0.5,
    restitution: 0.1
});


---

11.3 Collision Component

The CollisionComponent defines the shape used for physics interactions. Available types include:

box

sphere

capsule

cylinder

mesh (more expensive)


entity.addComponent('collision', {
    type: 'box',
    halfExtents: new pc.Vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
});

You must add both rigidbody and collision for physics to work properly.


---

11.4 Applying Forces and Impulses

You can manipulate rigid bodies using forces:

entity.rigidbody.applyForce(0, 100, 0); // Apply upward force
entity.rigidbody.applyImpulse(10, 0, 0); // Sudden push


---

11.5 Physics Events

PlayCanvas provides callbacks like onCollisionStart and onCollisionEnd for detecting physics interactions.

Example:

entity.collision.on('collisionstart', function (result) {
    console.log('Collision with: ', result.other.name);
});


---

11.6 Kinematic Objects

Use 'kinematic' bodies for scripted movement while still interacting with other physics entities.

They are unaffected by gravity and forces:

entity.rigidbody.linearVelocity = new pc.Vec3(1, 0, 0);


---

11.7 Joints and Constraints

Use constraints to create physical connections like hinges or springs. This is useful for doors, ropes, and other mechanical behaviors.

Note: These are only available through Ammo.js scripting, not the PlayCanvas Editor UI.


---

11.8 Optimization Tips

Avoid unnecessary 'mesh' colliders.

Disable physics on distant objects (enabled = false).

Reuse collision shapes when possible.

Next Chapter: Chapter 12 will introduce UI elements in PlayCanvas — including buttons, sliders, text, and creating interactive HUDs.
