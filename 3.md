Chapter 3: Understanding the PlayCanvas Editor Interface

The PlayCanvas Editor is a cloud-based, fully featured development environment tailored for creating interactive 3D content directly in your browser. Its interface is designed to be intuitive yet powerful, enabling developers to build, edit, and debug projects efficiently.

Main Panels Overview

Hierarchy Panel:
Displays all entities present in the current scene in a hierarchical tree structure. Entities can be nested, allowing parent-child relationships which are vital for organizing complex scenes. You can easily drag and drop entities to rearrange their hierarchy.

Viewport:
The main 3D canvas where you can view, select, and manipulate entities visually. It supports intuitive navigation controls such as orbiting, panning, and zooming. You can also use transform gizmos (move, rotate, scale) to adjust entities precisely.

Inspector Panel:
When you select an entity, its components and properties are displayed here. This includes transforms (position, rotation, scale), models, materials, scripts, physics components, and more. The Inspector allows for detailed configuration of each entityâ€™s behavior and appearance.

Assets Panel:
Manages all your project assets including 3D models, textures, scripts, audio files, fonts, and more. Assets are uploaded to the cloud and can be organized into folders for easy management. Version control helps track changes over time.

Console Panel:
Displays real-time logs, warnings, and errors generated by your scripts or engine. This is essential for debugging and performance tuning during development.


Navigation and Controls

Selecting Entities: You can select objects either from the Hierarchy Panel or directly in the Viewport.

Transform Tools: Use the Move, Rotate, and Scale gizmos to manipulate entities in the scene.

Camera Controls: Navigate the scene using mouse and keyboard shortcuts for orbiting, panning, and zooming.

Keyboard Shortcuts: PlayCanvas supports numerous hotkeys to speed up your workflow (e.g., W for Move, E for Rotate, R for Scale).


Collaboration Features

PlayCanvas is cloud-native, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Changes sync instantly, enabling real-time collaboration without version conflicts.

Summary

A solid understanding of the PlayCanvas Editor interface accelerates your workflow and enables efficient scene creation, editing, and debugging. Mastering these panels and controls lays the foundation for successful project development.
