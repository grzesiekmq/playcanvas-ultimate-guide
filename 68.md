Chapter 68 – Car Showroom Project in PlayCanvas


---

1. Overview

The Car Showroom project demonstrates how to create an interactive 3D environment where users can browse, inspect, and customize cars. It highlights PlayCanvas capabilities in rendering, user interaction, UI integration, and asset management.


---

2. Project Features

Multiple Car Models: Display a collection of cars with detailed 3D models.

Interactive Controls: Rotate, zoom, and pan the camera to view cars from all angles.

Car Selection UI: Select different cars using an intuitive UI panel.

Customization Options: Change car colors, wheels, and accessories dynamically.

Lighting and Reflections: Use environment maps and PBR materials to showcase realistic car surfaces.



---

3. Setting Up the Scene

Import car models in glTF format.

Arrange cars in the showroom layout with appropriate spacing.

Set up lighting (directional lights, environment probes) for realistic shading.



---

4. Camera Controls

Implement orbit controls using PlayCanvas scripts to allow smooth rotation around selected car.

Add zoom functionality with mouse wheel or touch gestures.



---

5. UI Implementation

Use PlayCanvas UI components (buttons, panels) for car selection.

Bind UI events to script functions that change the active car.

Add customization UI elements (color pickers, dropdowns).



---

6. Script Example: Changing Car Color

var CarShowroom = pc.createScript('carShowroom');

CarShowroom.prototype.initialize = function() {
    this.carEntities = this.app.root.findByTag('car');
    this.currentCarIndex = 0;
    this.setCarColor(this.carEntities[this.currentCarIndex], new pc.Color(1, 0, 0)); // red by default
};

CarShowroom.prototype.setCarColor = function(carEntity, color) {
    var materials = carEntity.model.meshInstances.map(function(mi) {
        return mi.material;
    });
    materials.forEach(function(mat) {
        mat.albedo = color;
        mat.update();
    });
};

CarShowroom.prototype.selectCar = function(index) {
    if (index >= 0 && index < this.carEntities.length) {
        this.currentCarIndex = index;
        // Logic to update camera focus, UI, etc.
    }
};


---

7. Performance Considerations

Use LOD for complex models to maintain frame rate.

Optimize texture resolutions and compress assets.

Manage entity activation/deactivation for unselected cars.



---

8. Extending the Showroom

Add animations like car doors opening.

Integrate sound effects for interactions.

Include a “test drive” mode with driving mechanics.



---

Summary

The Car Showroom project is a practical example illustrating how to combine PlayCanvas’s rendering, scripting, and UI systems to build an engaging interactive 3D application. It serves as a solid foundation for more complex visualization and configurator tools.
