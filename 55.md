Chapter 55 â€“ Real-Time Communication and Voice Chat Integration

In this chapter, weâ€™ll explore how to implement real-time communication (RTC) features in PlayCanvas games, including text chat, voice chat, and peer-to-peer (P2P) audio using WebRTC and WebSocket-based signaling.


---

1. Overview of RTC in Games

Real-time communication enhances multiplayer games with features like:

Team or global text chat

Voice channels (team, proximity, global)

In-game communication without external apps (e.g., Discord)



---

2. Text Chat via WebSocket

A simple chat system using the existing WebSocket connection:

Client (PlayCanvas):

function sendChatMessage(msg) {
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'chat', text: msg }));
}

socket.onmessage = (e) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
    if (data.type === 'chat') displayMessage(data.username, data.text);
};

Server:

ws.on('message', (msg) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(msg);
    if (data.type === 'chat') {
        broadcast({ type: 'chat', username: ws.username, text: data.text });
    }
});

Add timestamping, chat history, and moderation tools as needed.

3. Basics of WebRTC for Voice Chat

WebRTC enables peer-to-peer audio streaming between players without routing voice data through the game server. It still requires signaling (e.g., WebSocket) to establish the connection.


---

4. WebRTC Setup

1. Get user media:

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
  .then(stream => {
    localAudio.srcObject = stream;
    localStream = stream;
  });

2. Connect to peers using RTCPeerConnection:

const peer = new RTCPeerConnection();

localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
    peer.addTrack(track, localStream);
});

3. Exchange offers/answers using your WebSocket server:

socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'offer', sdp: peer.localDescription }));


---

5. Signaling Server (WebSocket)

Your signaling server handles the offer/answer exchange:

ws.on('message', (msg) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(msg);
    if (data.type === 'offer') {
        sendToTargetUser(data.targetId, data);
    }
});

This is needed to set up WebRTC connections between players.


---

6. Playing Remote Audio

On receiving remote tracks:

peer.ontrack = (event) => {
    const remoteAudio = new Audio();
    remoteAudio.srcObject = event.streams[0];
    remoteAudio.play();
};

You can display player names and mute controls.


---

7. Managing Voice Channels

Proximity-based chat: use player position and distance to enable/disable voice

Team voice: only route to players in the same team

Push-to-talk (PTT): toggle microphone with a key

Voice activity detection (VAD): auto-mute if silent



---

8. Integration with PlayCanvas UI

Use HTML overlay UI or 3D panels in-game:

<button onclick="toggleMic()">ðŸŽ¤ Mic</button>
<div id="chat"></div>
<input onkeydown="if(event.key==='Enter'){sendChat(this.value)}">

This can be styled using CSS or styled-components.


---

9. Bandwidth Considerations

Voice chat with many players is bandwidth-heavy

Consider using selective forwarding units (SFU) like Jitsi, Janus, or Mediasoup

Limit voice to small squads or rooms unless you host an SFU



---

10. Security and Privacy

Always ask for microphone permissions explicitly

Allow users to mute others

Use TURN servers for NAT traversal (fallback when P2P fails)

Sanitize chat input to avoid injection/XSS



---

Summary: Real-time communication brings social immersion to multiplayer games. PlayCanvas doesn't include native RTC, but using WebSocket and WebRTC APIs lets you build a custom, scalable system.
