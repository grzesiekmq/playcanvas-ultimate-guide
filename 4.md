Chapter 4: Entities and Components in PlayCanvas

In PlayCanvas, everything in your scene is built around entities and components. This modular system allows you to create complex interactive objects by combining simple building blocks.

Entities

An entity is a container or an object in the 3D world. Think of it as a node in the scene graph. Entities themselves are empty shells until you add components to give them functionality or appearance. They can be nested inside other entities, creating parent-child relationships that influence transformation hierarchies.

Components

Components are modular pieces of functionality attached to entities. Each component controls a specific aspect of the entity:

Model Component: Defines the 3D model or mesh that the entity displays.

Light Component: Adds lighting effects like directional, point, or spotlights.

Camera Component: Makes the entity a viewpoint for rendering the scene.

Script Component: Contains JavaScript code to define custom behavior.

Collision Component: Enables physics collision detection.

Rigid Body Component: Adds physics simulation like gravity and forces.

Audio Component: Controls sound playback.

Particle System Component: Creates particle effects like smoke or fire.


Adding Components

You add components through the Inspector panel by selecting an entity and choosing from the available component types. Multiple components can be added to a single entity.

Parent-Child Relationships

Transformations applied to a parent entity propagate to its children. This allows for hierarchical movement and rotation, which is essential for animating complex objects like vehicles or characters.

Custom Scripts

Scripts are written in JavaScript and attached to entities via the Script Component. They enable custom logic, interactions, AI behavior, and game mechanics.

Summary

Understanding entities and components is fundamental to working effectively in PlayCanvas. This architecture promotes flexibility and reusability, allowing developers to build intricate scenes from simple, composable parts.
