Chapter 65 – Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with PlayCanvas


---

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) represent a modern approach to building web applications that combine the best of web and native apps. They offer offline capabilities, installability, push notifications, and better performance. In this chapter, we explore how to turn your PlayCanvas project into a fully functional PWA, enhancing user experience and reach.


---

1. What is a Progressive Web App?

A PWA is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. Key features include:

Responsive design — works on any device, screen size, or orientation.

Offline support — thanks to service workers, PWAs can work without an internet connection.

Installability — users can “install” PWAs to their home screen without an app store.

Push notifications — re-engage users with timely messages.

Secure — served over HTTPS.



---

2. Why use PWA for PlayCanvas projects?

PlayCanvas apps are often heavy on assets and rely on web technologies. PWA can:

Improve loading speed via caching

Enable offline or limited connectivity usage

Provide a more native-like feel on mobile and desktop

Allow users to launch your app from home screen with custom icons and splash screens



---

3. Basic PWA Setup for PlayCanvas

The core of PWA functionality is the service worker, a JavaScript file that runs separately from your page and manages caching and network requests.

3.1 Manifest file

Create a manifest.json file describing your app:

{
  "name": "PlayCanvas Ultimate Guide",
  "short_name": "PC Guide",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#000000",
  "theme_color": "#2a9d8f",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}

Link it in your HTML head:

<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">

3.2 Registering Service Worker

In your main JavaScript file:

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
    .then(reg => console.log('Service Worker registered:', reg))
    .catch(err => console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', err));
}

4. Writing the Service Worker

A minimal service worker to cache core assets:

const CACHE_NAME = 'pc-ultimate-guide-cache-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/styles.css',
  '/app.js',
  '/manifest.json',
  '/icons/icon-192.png',
  '/icons/icon-512.png'
];

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then(cache => cache.addAll(urlsToCache))
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(response => response || fetch(event.request))
  );
});

This caches essential files during installation and serves cached files when offline.

5. Advanced Caching Strategies

Cache falling back to network: Try cache first, then network.

Network falling back to cache: Try network first, then cache.

Stale-while-revalidate: Serve cache immediately and update in background.


Libraries like Workbox can help automate service worker generation and caching strategies.


---

6. Testing Your PWA

Use Chrome DevTools > Application tab to check manifest, service worker, and cache.

Test offline mode by turning off network.

Install your PWA on supported devices and test launch experience.



---

7. Deploying a PlayCanvas PWA

Ensure your hosting supports HTTPS.

Verify correct MIME types for manifest and service worker files.

Use tools like Lighthouse to audit PWA compliance and performance.



---

8. Additional PWA Features for PlayCanvas

Push notifications to notify players of events or updates.

Background sync for deferred operations.

Periodic updates of assets using cache versioning.



---

Summary

Converting your PlayCanvas project into a Progressive Web App significantly enhances usability and reach. Implementing service workers and a manifest file enables offline capabilities, installability, and better performance — crucial features for modern web applications.
