Chapter 59 – Optimizing WebXR Content for Performance and Compatibility

WebXR opens new possibilities for immersive and spatial experiences in the browser, but it also brings new performance bottlenecks and compatibility issues across devices. This chapter explores practical strategies to optimize your WebXR apps built with PlayCanvas—especially for mobile AR/VR targets.


---

1. Understand WebXR Device Diversity

Each WebXR device varies in:

Performance (mobile vs. headset vs. desktop)

Capabilities (e.g., AR hit testing, hand tracking)

Browser behavior (e.g., Chrome vs. Edge vs. Oculus Browser)


Use feature detection:

if (this.app.xr.supported && this.app.xr.isAvailable(pc.XRTYPE_AR)) {
    // Proceed safely
}


---

2. Keep Draw Calls to a Minimum

Draw calls multiply fast in VR/AR:

You’re rendering for both eyes (VR)

AR needs fast overlays with real-world context


Best Practices:

Merge meshes using batching or static mesh groups

Minimize material variety (each unique material = new draw call)

Avoid overdraw (no large invisible quads or semi-transparent overlaps)



---

3. Use Efficient Shaders and Materials

Avoid complex node-based shaders; prefer baked PBR maps

Disable unnecessary features in StandardMaterial, like clearcoat or anisotropy

Use compressed textures (e.g., Basis) to reduce GPU memory



---

4. Optimize Lighting Strategy

In AR:

Use ambient light estimation (when supported)

Prefer light probes over dynamic lights

Bake lighting into the textures for static content


In VR:

Use one directional light max for real-time lighting

Fake shadows with blob decals or baked AO



---

5. Asset Loading and Streaming

Your WebXR experience must load fast:

Use asset bundles

Lazy-load secondary content (e.g., props, UI assets)

Compress GLB/GLTF with Draco or meshopt


Tip: Preload only essentials. The rest should load after xrstart.


---

6. Reduce Physics and Script Overhead

Physics in WebXR:

Avoid physics where possible in AR (e.g., object placement is enough)

Reduce collision mesh complexity (e.g., use bounding boxes or spheres)


Script overhead:

Don't update non-visible objects

Move logic out of update() where possible



---

7. Optimize Camera Settings

Use the minimal camera stack:

Only the XR camera should be active

Turn off post-processing (especially expensive effects like bloom, SSAO)

Disable shadow maps unless absolutely necessary



---

8. Profile and Benchmark on Target Devices

Always test on actual devices, not just desktop browser emulators.

Use:

PlayCanvas Profiler (F10) to inspect draw calls, memory, materials

Chrome’s chrome://inspect for mobile debugging

WebXR polyfill fallbacks (if needed)



---

9. Handle Device and Session Failures

Robust fallback logic is crucial:

this.app.xr.on('error', function (err) {
    console.warn("WebXR error", err);
    // Fallback to non-XR experience
});

Consider:

Detecting AR support and falling back to gyroscope or orbit control

Releasing GPU resources when XR session ends



---

10. Bundle Size and Deployment

Use:

Minified builds with rollup/webpack

CDN for libraries and third-party tools

Service workers to cache heavy assets locally


Also: Host over HTTPS with optimized headers (gzip, Brotli).


---

Summary

WebXR content requires surgical performance optimization and wide device compatibility. By batching geometry, compressing assets, and carefully managing memory and scripts, you can ensure a smooth, battery-efficient experience on mobile AR and standalone VR headsets.
