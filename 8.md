Chapter 8: Scripting in PlayCanvas

Scripting is at the heart of creating interactivity and custom behavior in PlayCanvas. This chapter explores the scripting system, how to write modular scripts, and best practices for maintainable code.


---

8.1 Script Components and Scripts

Scripts are JavaScript files attached to entities via the script component. They control logic such as player movement, AI behavior, or UI interactions.

Add a script component to an entity and assign one or more scripts.


---

8.2 Script Lifecycle Methods

Scripts support several lifecycle callbacks:

initialize(): Called once when the script instance is created.

postInitialize(): Called after all script instances are initialized.

update(dt): Called every frame; dt is the delta time.

postUpdate(dt): Called after the update phase.

swap(old): Called when the script instance is replaced.

destroy(): Called before the script instance is removed.


Example:

var Player = pc.createScript('player');

Player.prototype.initialize = function() {
    console.log('Player script initialized');
};

Player.prototype.update = function(dt) {
    this.entity.translate(0, 0, 1 * dt);
};


---

8.3 Script Attributes

Attributes expose editable properties in the Editor:

Player.attributes.add('speed', { type: 'number', default: 5 });

Access in script:

this.speed

Attributes support various types: number, string, boolean, asset, entity, vec3, rgb, json, etc.


---

8.4 Communicating Between Scripts

Use this.app or this.entity references to interact:

var enemy = this.app.root.findByName('Enemy');
enemy.script.enemyAI.enabled = true;

You can listen and fire events:

this.entity.fire('jump');
this.entity.on('jump', function() { /*...*/ });


---

8.5 Script Ordering and Dependencies

Control script execution order via script component or script attributes.

Avoid circular dependencies by keeping scripts modular.


---

8.6 Script Injection

The Editor injects attribute values and entities automatically when scripts are attached, reducing manual setup.


---

8.7 Best Practices

Keep scripts focused and reusable.

Avoid monolithic scripts handling too many responsibilities.

Use events for decoupling.

Name scripts clearly.

Document script purpose and usage.
