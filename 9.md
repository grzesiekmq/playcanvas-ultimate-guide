Chapter 9: UI System in PlayCanvas

Creating user interfaces is crucial for player interaction. PlayCanvas offers a flexible 2D UI system based on the element component, supporting buttons, text, images, and layouts.

9.1 Element Component Basics

The element component is attached to entities and defines UI elements such as:

text

image

button

group

screen


Example of adding a text element:

entity.addComponent('element', {
    type: 'text',
    text: 'Hello World',
    fontAsset: app.assets.find('Arial', 'font').id,
    fontSize: 24,
    color: pc.Color.WHITE
});


---

9.2 UI Layout and Anchoring

Elements support anchoring and pivot for responsive layouts:

Anchors define the reference points relative to the parent.

Pivot is the element’s own origin point.


Using anchors, UI can adapt to different screen sizes dynamically.


---

9.3 Buttons and Interaction

Buttons are special elements with click events:

entity.addComponent('element', {
    type: 'button'
});

entity.button.on('click', function () {
    console.log('Button clicked');
});

Buttons support hover, pressed, and focused states with customizable colors and sprites.


---

9.4 UI Screens

The screen element acts as a root container for UI. It automatically scales and adjusts elements based on the canvas size and resolution.


---

9.5 Animations and Transitions

You can animate UI elements via scripting or the animation system, enabling smooth fades, slides, and other effects.


---

9.6 Best Practices

Use groups to organize complex UIs.

Test UI responsiveness on different devices.

Keep UI logic separate from game logic.

Use assets efficiently to minimize memory usage.
