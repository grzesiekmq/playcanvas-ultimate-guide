Chapter 39: Multiplayer and Networking Basics

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of adding multiplayer features to your PlayCanvas projects, covering networking basics and synchronization.

Understanding Multiplayer Architectures

Client-Server Model: One authoritative server manages game state; clients send inputs and receive updates.

Peer-to-Peer Model: Clients communicate directly, suitable for small scale or local games.


Networking Protocols

WebSockets: Persistent connection ideal for real-time communication.

WebRTC: Peer-to-peer connections with lower latency.

HTTP Requests: For non-real-time or occasional data exchanges.


Synchronization Techniques

State Synchronization: Periodically sending full or partial game state.

Event-based: Sending discrete events like player actions.

Interpolation and Prediction: Smooth movement and compensate for latency.


Integrating Networking in PlayCanvas

Use external services like Socket.io or custom backend servers.

Structure your game logic to separate authoritative and client-side logic.

Handle connection issues gracefully.


Security Considerations

Validate client data on the server.

Prevent cheating with server authority.


Summary

Adding multiplayer involves understanding networking fundamentals, choosing the right architecture, and carefully synchronizing game state for smooth gameplay.
