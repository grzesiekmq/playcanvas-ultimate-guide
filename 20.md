Chapter 20: Sound and Audio Integration

Audio is a vital element in game development—it enhances immersion, reinforces feedback, and sets the emotional tone. PlayCanvas provides a robust system for managing and playing sounds, including 3D positional audio.

20.1 The Sound Component

To enable audio playback in your project, use the sound component. This component lets you attach and manage multiple sound slots on a single entity.

Steps to add sound:

1. Create a new Entity (e.g., MusicPlayer or ExplosionSound).


2. Add a Sound component.


3. In the component, define one or more slots.


4. Load and assign audio assets (WAV, MP3, OGG).



Each slot can have different properties:

Looping (loop)

Volume

Autoplay

3D spatialization (if positional)


Example configuration for a background music slot:

{
  "name": "music",
  "asset": "background_theme.ogg",
  "loop": true,
  "volume": 0.5,
  "autoPlay": true
}


---

20.2 Loading Audio Assets

Audio assets must be imported into your project:

Go to the Assets panel.

Drag and drop .ogg or .mp3 files.

Ensure correct asset types are assigned (Sound → Audio).


You can also categorize them in folders (e.g., sfx, music, ui).


---

20.3 Basic Sound Playback

Use scripts to play or stop sounds on demand.

this.entity.sound.play('explosion');
this.entity.sound.stop('explosion');

To play a sound only once, no loop:

this.entity.sound.play('click');


---

20.4 3D Positional Audio

Enable 3D audio for realism in-world.

Attach a sound component to a physical entity.

Enable the Positional toggle in the slot.

Set parameters like minDistance and maxDistance.

Sounds will attenuate based on camera proximity.


Use for footsteps, environmental sounds, character voices, etc.


---

20.5 Audio Listener

The camera (or player entity) should have a soundListener component to correctly perceive spatial audio.

Add soundListener to your main camera.

Only one listener should be active in the scene.


Without a listener, 3D sounds won’t be heard properly.


---

20.6 Triggering Sound with Events

Tie sound playback to gameplay actions:

// Inside script
this.app.on('enemy:hit', () => {
    this.entity.sound.play('hit');
});

Pair it with event-based systems or UI interactions (e.g., click sound):

this.entity.element.on('click', () => {
    this.app.root.findByName('UISound').sound.play('click');
});


---

20.7 Dynamic Audio Control

Volume can be adjusted via code:

this.entity.sound.volume = 0.2;

You can also fade sounds in or out manually:

// Fade out
app.tween(this.entity.sound).to({ volume: 0 }, 1.0, pc.Linear).start();

Useful for scene transitions, muting, or menu handling.


---

20.8 Grouping Sounds

Although PlayCanvas doesn’t have built-in sound groups (like Unity’s AudioMixers), you can simulate this with an abstraction layer:

// App-level control
this.app.fire('volume:set', { group: 'sfx', volume: 0.6 });

Maintain your own registry of sound entities to manipulate by group or type.


---

20.9 Optimizing Audio

Compress large background music files.

Limit simultaneous ambient sounds.

Avoid overlapping identical sounds to prevent audio distortion.

Preload important audio to avoid runtime delays.



---

20.10 Muting and Audio Preferences

Allow players to mute music, sound effects, or both.

Use global flags or UI toggles.

Persist settings using localStorage.


localStorage.setItem('muteMusic', true);

Check on load:

if (localStorage.getItem('muteMusic') === 'true') {
    this.musicEntity.sound.volume = 0;
}
