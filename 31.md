Chapter 31: Scene Optimization

Creating visually rich and interactive scenes in PlayCanvas is exciting, but it can quickly become a performance challenge, especially on less powerful devices or mobile platforms. This chapter covers practical strategies to optimize your scenes for smooth framerates while maintaining visual quality.

31.1 Why Optimize?

High polygon counts, excessive draw calls, large textures, and complex shaders can cause FPS drops. Optimizing:

Improves user experience

Reduces load times

Saves battery on mobiles

Helps meet hardware constraints



---

31.2 Profiling Tools

Before optimizing, profile your scene:

PlayCanvas Developer Tools: Built-in performance stats.

Chrome DevTools: CPU and GPU profiling.

WebGL Inspector: For analyzing draw calls.

Remote Debugging: On mobile devices.


Identify bottlenecks: CPU-heavy scripts? Too many draw calls? Large textures?


---

31.3 Reducing Draw Calls

Draw calls happen when the GPU is told to render geometry. High draw call counts are a common cause of slowdowns.

Tips:

Batching: Combine multiple meshes/materials to reduce calls.

Use static batching if objects don’t move.

Use dynamic batching for small moving objects sharing the same material.

Avoid frequent material switches.


In PlayCanvas, batching can be done by:

entity.model.batch( /* options */ );

Or by carefully structuring your scene and assets.


---

31.4 Level of Detail (LOD)

LOD reduces polygon count for distant objects.

Create multiple versions of a mesh (high-poly close, low-poly far).

Switch meshes based on camera distance.

PlayCanvas supports LOD via scripting or plugins.


Example:

if (distance > threshold) {
    entity.model.mesh = lowPolyMesh;
} else {
    entity.model.mesh = highPolyMesh;
}


---

31.5 Texture Optimization

Compress textures using formats like DXT, ETC2, or ASTC.

Use mipmaps to reduce aliasing and improve rendering speed.

Avoid unnecessarily large textures.

Use texture atlases to reduce material switches.



---

31.6 Efficient Use of Lights

Limit the number of dynamic lights.

Use baked lighting when possible.

Use light probes for indirect lighting.

Disable shadows on lights if performance is critical.



---

31.7 Occlusion Culling

Hide objects not visible to the camera to save rendering time.

PlayCanvas doesn’t have built-in occlusion culling but you can:

Use frustum culling (default).

Implement manual culling by enabling/disabling entities based on camera visibility.



---

31.8 Script Optimization

Avoid heavy logic inside update if possible.

Cache references and avoid costly calls like findByName every frame.

Use throttling or debouncing for expensive operations.

Profile scripts and optimize hotspots.



---

31.9 Physics Optimization

Use simplified collision shapes.

Reduce physics simulation frequency.

Avoid excessive rigid body counts.



---

31.10 Build and Asset Pipeline

Use draco compression for meshes.

Optimize asset import settings.

Remove unused assets.

Use proper asset bundle partitioning.
