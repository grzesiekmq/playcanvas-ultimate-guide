Chapter 66 – Deploying PlayCanvas Projects Efficiently with CI/CD Pipelines


---

1. Introduction to CI/CD for PlayCanvas

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are modern development practices that automate building, testing, and deploying applications. For PlayCanvas projects, CI/CD can streamline your workflow, ensure quality, and reduce manual errors during deployment.


---

2. Benefits of CI/CD in PlayCanvas Development

Automated builds and testing: Every commit triggers build and validation processes.

Faster release cycles: Updates reach users faster.

Consistent deployment: Avoids configuration drift or human error.

Easy rollback: Maintain previous stable versions.

Collaboration: Helps teams work seamlessly.



---

3. Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline

You can use popular platforms such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins. Here’s a basic flow:

1. Code pushed to repository


2. Automated build and test


3. Deploy to hosting platform

4. Example: GitHub Actions Workflow for PlayCanvas

Create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file:

name: PlayCanvas Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy to Netlify
      uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1.1
      with:
        publish-dir: ./dist
        production-deploy: true
        netlify-auth-token: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        netlify-site-id: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}

5. Managing Secrets and Environment Variables

Store sensitive data (API keys, tokens) securely using your CI platform's secrets management.

Use environment variables to configure builds.



---

6. Testing and Validation

Run unit tests and linting during CI to catch issues early.

Consider integrating PlayCanvas Editor API tests if applicable.



---

7. Deploying to Other Platforms

You can adapt CI/CD workflows for:

GitHub Pages

Vercel

AWS S3 + CloudFront

Custom VPS or Docker containers



---

8. Rollback and Versioning

Keep track of deployed versions via tags.

Automate rollback in case of failures.



---

Summary

Automating your PlayCanvas project deployment with CI/CD pipelines improves reliability, speed, and collaboration. Using platforms like GitHub Actions integrates smoothly with your repository and hosting services.
