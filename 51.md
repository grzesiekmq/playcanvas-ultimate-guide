Chapter 51 – Implementing Save and Load Systems

In this chapter, we'll explore how to implement save and load mechanisms in PlayCanvas, enabling players or users to persist data such as game progress, settings, or scene configurations.


---

1. Types of Data to Persist

Depending on your project type, you may want to save:

Game state (e.g. score, level, inventory)

Player settings (e.g. audio, quality, control preferences)

Scene setup or editor data

Product configurations (in commercial apps)



---

2. Storage Methods

a. Local Storage (Browser)

Useful for storing small bits of data persistently.

// Saving
localStorage.setItem("playerScore", 2500);

// Loading
const score = localStorage.getItem("playerScore");

b. PlayCanvas Cloud or External API

For multiplayer or multi-device usage, saving to a server is better.

Use fetch() for REST APIs:

fetch("https://myserver.com/save", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ score: 2500 }),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});


---

3. Serialization Techniques

Use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to serialize complex structures:

const data = {
  player: {
    name: "Grisza",
    position: [0, 2, 5],
    inventory: ["sword", "shield"]
  }
};

localStorage.setItem("saveData", JSON.stringify(data));

// Load
const loaded = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("saveData"));


---

4. Autosave Implementation

Add regular save checkpoints in games:

this.app.on("checkpoint", () => {
  const saveData = { level: 2, score: 6000 };
  localStorage.setItem("autosave", JSON.stringify(saveData));
});

You can trigger checkpoints on events like level completion or every few minutes.


---

5. Scene Reloading from Save

You can reapply saved values to objects:

const pos = new pc.Vec3().fromArray(saveData.player.position);
this.entity.setPosition(pos);

For complex objects, use identifiers to find and reconfigure them.


---

6. UI for Save/Load

Provide buttons for manual saving and loading:

<button onclick="saveGame()">Save</button>
<button onclick="loadGame()">Load</button>

And hook them to appropriate handlers in your script.
