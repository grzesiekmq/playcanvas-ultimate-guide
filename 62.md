Chapter 62 – Physics-Based Interaction in VR: Hands, Grabbing, and Collisions

Immersive VR goes far beyond simple ray selection — it allows users to reach out, grab objects, throw them, or push buttons with natural motions. This chapter explores how to use PlayCanvas with WebXR to simulate physics-based interaction, enabling realistic grabbing, object manipulation, and collision-based feedback.

1. The Core Interaction Model

Most VR physical interaction is built around three principles:

Detection – Check when a controller or hand is near a grabbable object.

Attachment – Parent the object to the hand/controller on "grab."

Physics handling – Optionally use physics for natural release behavior.


In PlayCanvas, we use:

collision + rigidbody components

WebXR controller input

Events like triggerdown / triggerup



---

2. Setting Up the Environment

You need:

A VR-compatible scene

Controllers with physics-enabled hands (e.g., invisible sphere/box)

Interactable objects with rigidbody (dynamic) and collision components


Example object setup:

const box = new pc.Entity("Box");
box.addComponent("model", { type: "box" });
box.addComponent("rigidbody", { type: "dynamic", mass: 1 });
box.addComponent("collision", { type: "box" });
app.root.addChild(box);


---

3. Detecting Object Contact

Use a trigger volume (e.g., small invisible sphere on the controller hand) to detect nearby objects:

controller.addComponent("collision", {
    type: "sphere",
    radius: 0.05
});
controller.addComponent("rigidbody", {
    type: "kinematic
});

Listen for collision events:

controller.script.create("grabLogic");

grabLogic.prototype.onCollisionStart = function (result) {
    this.possibleGrab = result.other; // store reference
};


---

4. Grabbing and Releasing

On triggerdown, attach the object:

this.possibleGrab.rigidbody.enabled = false;
this.possibleGrab.reparent(this.entity);

On triggerup, release with momentum:

this.possibleGrab.rigidbody.enabled = true;
this.app.root.addChild(this.possibleGrab);

const velocity = this.calculateReleaseVelocity();
this.possibleGrab.rigidbody.linearVelocity = velocity;

The velocity can be approximated from controller movement deltas.


---

5. Two-Handed Objects

For two-hand grabs (e.g., rifles, tools):

Track both controllers

Calculate relative grip position

Interpolate object orientation from both hands


Not trivial, but achievable with vector math and quaternion slerping:

const dir = handB.getPosition().clone().sub(handA.getPosition());
const rotation = new pc.Quat().setFromVectors(pc.Vec3.FORWARD, dir);


---

6. Object Constraints

Some objects should behave in constrained ways:

Doors (hinges)

Drawers (sliders)

Levers (rotation on one axis)


Use joint constraints via Ammo.js:

const hinge = new Ammo.btHingeConstraint(...);
physicsWorld.addConstraint(hinge, true);

Note: Requires integrating lower-level Ammo API beyond PlayCanvas wrappers.


---

7. Throwing and Collision Response

For throwing:

Apply velocity and angular velocity at release

Ensure the object's physics layer is dynamic

Add collision sound effects and particle feedback


Example on collision:

box.collision.on('collisionstart', function (result) {
    app.fire('sfx:play', 'impact.wav');
});


---

8. Grabbable Tagging

Tag grabbable objects for easier detection:

grabbableEntity.tags.add("grabbable");

Then filter:

if (entity.tags.has("grabbable")) {
    // enable interaction
}


---

9. Force Feedback and Haptics

WebXR provides haptic support on compatible controllers:

inputSource.gamepad.hapticActuators[0].pulse(1.0, 100);

Use haptics on:

Grab success

Impact

Throw release



---

10. Performance Considerations

Physics are CPU-heavy:

Limit number of dynamic objects

Disable physics on idle objects

Avoid stacking many bodies

Use simplified colliders (e.g., boxes/spheres)


Also, debounce grab logic to prevent jitter or unwanted re-grabbing.


---

Summary

Realistic VR interaction is about giving players tactile feedback and believable responses. In PlayCanvas, combining physics components, WebXR controller input, and smart parenting techniques enables immersive object interaction, from picking up tools to throwing cubes across the room.
