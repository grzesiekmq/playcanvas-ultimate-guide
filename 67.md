Chapter 67 – Integrating Analytics and User Tracking in PlayCanvas


---

1. Why Integrate Analytics?

Understanding user behavior, engagement, and application performance is vital for continuous improvement. Analytics provides insights on:

User retention and session duration

Popular features and user flow

Crash reports and performance metrics

Geographic and device demographics



---

2. Choosing an Analytics Platform

Popular options include:

Google Analytics (GA4) — versatile, widely used.

Mixpanel — focused on user events and funnels.

Amplitude — deep behavioral analytics.

PlayCanvas-specific tools — some tools integrate directly with the engine.



---

3. Setting Up Google Analytics in PlayCanvas

3.1 Creating a GA4 Property

Sign up on Google Analytics.

Create a new GA4 property for your PlayCanvas app.

Get the measurement ID (starts with G-).


3.2 Adding GA4 to PlayCanvas

Insert the GA script tag in your HTML page hosting the PlayCanvas app:

<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>

3.3 Tracking Custom Events

Use PlayCanvas script code to send events:

if (typeof gtag === 'function') {
  gtag('event', 'level_complete', {
    'level': 3,
    'score': 4500
  });
}

4. Tracking Player Sessions and Behavior

Track session start and end times.

Monitor user actions: button clicks, level completions, errors.

Use custom dimensions for player attributes.



---

5. Privacy and Compliance

Inform users about data collection.

Respect GDPR and CCPA regulations.

Allow opt-out where necessary.



---

6. Visualizing and Using Analytics Data

Use dashboards to monitor KPIs.

Adapt gameplay or UI based on insights.

Identify bottlenecks or popular features.



---

7. Other Tools to Consider

Sentry for error tracking.

Firebase Analytics for integration with Google’s mobile tools.

Hotjar for heatmaps and session recordings.

Summary

Analytics integration in PlayCanvas projects helps optimize user experience and game performance by providing actionable insights. Leveraging tools like Google Analytics and custom events empowers data-driven development.
