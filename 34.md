Chapter 34: Post-Processing Effects (Detailed)

In this chapter, we dive deeper into the post-processing effects available in PlayCanvas, exploring how to create visually stunning enhancements that elevate the quality and feel of your 3D scenes and games.

What is Post-Processing?

Post-processing refers to the set of effects applied to the rendered image after the main rendering pass has completed. These effects can dramatically improve visual quality by adding effects such as bloom, depth of field, color grading, motion blur, and more.

Built-in Post-Processing Effects in PlayCanvas

PlayCanvas provides several built-in post-processing effects, which can be combined and customized:

Bloom: Adds a glowing effect around bright areas, simulating light bleeding.

Depth of Field (DoF): Simulates camera focus by blurring objects outside the focus range.

Tone Mapping: Adjusts the color values to map high dynamic range colors to the displayable range.

Vignette: Darkens the edges of the screen for a cinematic effect.

Color Grading: Alters the colors for mood and style.

Motion Blur: Blurs fast-moving objects to simulate motion.

Chromatic Aberration: Slight color shifts around edges to mimic lens distortion.


Implementing Post-Processing Effects

1. Enable the Post-Processing Layer
To use post-processing, ensure the camera has a post-processing layer enabled.


2. Add Effects to the Layer
Effects are added programmatically or via the PlayCanvas Editor. For example:

var camera = this.app.root.findByName('Camera');
var layer = camera.camera.postEffects;
layer.addEffect(new pc.BloomEffect(this.app));


3. Customize Effect Parameters
Each effect exposes parameters such as intensity, threshold, radius, and color, which can be tuned for the desired look.



Creating Custom Post-Processing Effects

If the built-in effects don't cover your needs, PlayCanvas allows you to create custom post-processing shaders:

Write a fragment shader that processes the screen texture.

Create a custom effect class inheriting from pc.PostEffect.

Add your effect to the camera's post-processing layer.


This flexibility lets you implement unique visual styles or experimental effects.

Performance Considerations

Post-processing effects can be costly in terms of GPU performance, especially on lower-end devices. To maintain good performance:

Use only necessary effects.

Optimize shader code for efficiency.

Consider adjusting effect quality settings dynamically based on hardware.


Summary

Advanced post-processing significantly enhances visual fidelity and immersion. Understanding how to apply and customize these effects allows developers to create polished and professional experiences in PlayCanvas.
