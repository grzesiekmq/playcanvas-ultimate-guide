Chapter 42: Lighting Techniques and Optimization

This chapter dives into various lighting methods available in PlayCanvas and how to optimize lighting for performance and visual quality.

Types of Lights

Directional Light: Simulates sunlight; affects the entire scene uniformly.

Point Light: Emits light in all directions from a single point.

Spotlight: Emits light in a cone shape.

Ambient Light: Provides global, non-directional lighting.


Real-time vs Baked Lighting

Real-time lighting: Dynamic but performance-heavy.

Baked lighting: Precomputed lightmaps for static objects; efficient but less flexible.


Shadow Casting

Enable shadows on lights to add depth.

Adjust shadow resolution and distance to balance quality and performance.


Lightmapping Workflow

Use external tools or PlayCanvas features to bake lighting into textures.

Optimize lightmaps for size and resolution.


Global Illumination Techniques

Emulate indirect lighting with techniques like ambient occlusion and reflection probes.


Performance Tips

Limit the number of dynamic lights.

Use light culling and layering.

Optimize shader complexity.


Summary

Effective lighting enhances scene realism, but balancing quality and performance is key to maintaining smooth gameplay.
