Chapter 52 – Creating Cinematic Camera Systems

Cinematic cameras are crucial for delivering polished game intros, cutscenes, transitions, and dramatic moments. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to set up and control cameras in PlayCanvas to produce professional-looking camera movements and effects.


---

1. Goals of Cinematic Cameras

Cinematic camera systems help you:

Tell stories through perspective

Emphasize action or dialogue

Create smooth transitions between gameplay and cutscenes

Add emotional or dramatic tone to scenes



---

2. Multiple Camera Setup

You can have multiple cameras in a PlayCanvas scene. To switch between them:

this.app.scene.layers.getLayerByName("World").cameras = [this.cameraEntity.camera];

Use camera priorities to control which camera renders:

this.entity.camera.priority = 1;


---

3. Key Camera Properties

Control camera behavior through properties:

fov – Field of View

nearClip, farClip – Clipping planes

clearColor – Background color

projection – Perspective or orthographic


You can adjust these dynamically:

this.entity.camera.fov = 60;


---

4. Smooth Camera Transitions

Use tweening libraries (like tween.js) to animate camera position and rotation.

new TWEEN.Tween(this.entity.getPosition())
  .to({ x: 5, y: 3, z: 10 }, 2000)
  .easing(TWEEN.Easing.Quadratic.InOut)
  .start();

For smooth rotation:

new TWEEN.Tween(this.entity.getEulerAngles())
  .to({ x: 30, y: 180, z: 0 }, 2000)
  .onUpdate(function (val) {
    cameraEntity.setEulerAngles(val.x, val.y, val.z);
  })
  .start();


---

5. Spline-Based Camera Paths

Use a Catmull-Rom spline or custom curve to move the camera smoothly through predefined points.

Store path points:

const path = [
  new pc.Vec3(0, 1, 5),
  new pc.Vec3(2, 1, 3),
  new pc.Vec3(4, 2, 0)
];

Interpolate between them over time. You can manually lerp between two points:

const pos = new pc.Vec3().lerp(start, end, t);
cameraEntity.setPosition(pos);


---

6. Blend Gameplay and Cutscenes

Disable player controls and switch to the cinematic camera. Use events to transition:

this.app.fire("disableControls");
this.app.fire("startCinematic");

After the sequence:

this.app.fire("enableControls");
this.app.fire("returnToGameplay");


---

7. Letterboxing and Visual Enhancements

Add UI overlays (black bars) to simulate widescreen cinematic feel:

<div class="letterbox top"></div>
<div class="letterbox bottom"></div>

Use CSS for animation and transitions in/out.


---

8. Audio and Timing Sync

Trigger sounds or dialogue precisely during camera sequences:

setTimeout(() => {
  this.app.fire("playDialogue", "The invasion has begun...");
}, 1500);


---

9. Debugging Camera Paths

Add visible path markers (small entities) to preview your route in the editor.

const marker = new pc.Entity();
marker.addComponent("model", { type: "box" });
marker.setLocalPosition(pathPoint);
this.app.root.addChild(marker);


---

Cinematic camera systems elevate your PlayCanvas experience to a more immersive, storytelling-driven level.
