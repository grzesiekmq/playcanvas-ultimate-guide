Chapter 53 – Networked Multiplayer Concepts

Adding networked multiplayer to your PlayCanvas game opens up real-time interactions between players. While PlayCanvas doesn’t include built-in multiplayer tools, it can easily integrate with external libraries and backends such as WebSockets, Colyseus, or Firebase.


---

1. Multiplayer Architecture Overview

A typical real-time multiplayer setup consists of:

Client: PlayCanvas game running in the browser

Server: Node.js backend managing game state, rooms, and messaging

Transport: Communication via WebSocket, WebRTC, or HTTP polling


There are two common models:

Authoritative server: Server controls game state (secure, fair)

Peer-to-peer: Clients communicate directly (low-latency, insecure)



---

2. Setting Up WebSocket Communication

Example: Connecting a PlayCanvas client to a WebSocket server.

Client side (PlayCanvas):

const socket = new WebSocket('wss://yourserver.com');

socket.addEventListener('open', () => {
    console.log('Connected to server');
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'join', playerId: 123 }));
});

socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.type === 'updatePlayer') {
        updateRemotePlayer(data.payload);
    }
});

Server side (Node.js):

const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
    ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
        const data = JSON.parse(message);
        // Process data
    });
});


---

3. Synchronizing Player State

Clients send position updates periodically. Server broadcasts them to others.

Client side:

setInterval(() => {
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: 'position',
        payload: playerEntity.getPosition()
    }));
}, 100);

Server side:

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'updatePlayer',
    payload: { id: playerId, pos: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 } }
}));


---

4. Interpolation & Lag Compensation

To smooth out jittery movement due to latency:

// Interpolate toward new position
remotePlayerEntity.setPosition(
    pc.Vec3.lerp(remotePlayerEntity.getPosition(), newPosition, 0.1)
);

You can also buffer updates and play them slightly delayed for accuracy.


---

5. Managing Rooms and Sessions

Use unique room IDs for different game lobbies:

Client joins room via joinRoom("abc123")

Server tracks which players are in which room

Broadcast updates only to players in the same room



---

6. Player Joining and Leaving

Handle lifecycle events to spawn/despawn players:

socket.on('playerJoined', (data) => {
    spawnRemotePlayer(data.id, data.position);
});

socket.on('playerLeft', (id) => {
    removeRemotePlayer(id);
});


---

7. Security and Anti-Cheating

To prevent cheating:

Validate actions on the server

Do not trust client-side movement or collisions

Consider implementing server-side physics for competitive games



---

8. Choosing a Library or Service

Some good libraries for PlayCanvas multiplayer:

Colyseus (authoritative server framework)

Socket.io (simpler, WebSocket wrapper)

WebRTC (peer-to-peer, e.g. via PeerJS)



---

9. Syncing Custom Game Logic

Design protocol for syncing additional game data:

{
  "type": "action",
  "payload": {
    "type": "shoot",
    "position": [1, 2, 3],
    "direction": [0, 0, -1]
  }
}

Your game should be flexible enough to respond to any state update.


---

10. Testing Multiplayer Locally

Use localhost WebSocket server for development:

const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");

Run multiple browser tabs or machines to simulate different clients.

Multiplayer adds complexity but also immense value to your game. Next up, we’ll explore Chapter 54 – Matchmaking and Lobby Systems, where we look at the UX and systems behind joining games.
