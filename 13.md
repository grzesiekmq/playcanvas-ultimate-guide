Chapter 13: Input Handling in PlayCanvas

Robust input handling is a foundational aspect of any interactive application or game. PlayCanvas provides an abstraction layer over input devices such as keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepads through its built-in pc.Application.input system.


---

13.1 Input System Overview

PlayCanvas centralizes input through:

app.keyboard: Keyboard input

app.mouse: Mouse input

app.touch: Touch input

app.gamepads: Gamepad input


All are accessible via the main application instance.

Example:

if (app.keyboard.isPressed(pc.KEY_SPACE)) {
    console.log("Jump!");
}


---

13.2 Keyboard Input

The pc.Keyboard object detects key presses and releases.

Common Methods:

isPressed(key): Checks if key is held down.

on("keydown", callback): Listens for key down events.

on("keyup", callback): Listens for key up events.


Example:

app.keyboard.on("keydown", function (e) {
    if (e.key === pc.KEY_W) {
        console.log("Move forward");
    }
});

Use e.event.preventDefault() if you want to suppress default browser actions.


---

13.3 Mouse Input

The pc.Mouse object allows you to track movement, button clicks, and wheel scrolls.

Example:

app.mouse.on("mousedown", function (e) {
    if (e.button === pc.MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT) {
        console.log("Left click");
    }
});

Also track mousemove, mouseup, and mousewheel events.


---

13.4 Touch Input

On mobile and tablets, use app.touch to handle multi-touch gestures.

app.touch.on("touchstart", function (e) {
    console.log("Touch start at", e.touches[0].x, e.touches[0].y);
});

Use touchstart, touchend, and touchmove events. The e.touches array gives details for each finger.


---

13.5 Gamepad Support

PlayCanvas supports standard gamepads via app.gamepads.

You can poll them:

let pad = app.gamepads.getPad(0);
if (pad && pad.buttons[0].pressed) {
    console.log("A button pressed");
}

Or respond to connection events:

app.gamepads.on("connect", function (pad) {
    console.log("Gamepad connected:", pad.index);
});


---

13.6 Input in Scripts

For gameplay logic, handle input in the update method:

MyController.prototype.update = function (dt) {
    if (this.app.keyboard.isPressed(pc.KEY_LEFT)) {
        this.entity.translateLocal(-dt, 0, 0);
    }
};

This ensures continuous response to input.


---

13.7 Mobile vs Desktop Input

Detect touch availability via this.app.touch.

Provide fallback input for keyboard/mouse.

Avoid hardcoding keys — offer rebindable control schemes when possible.



---

13.8 Input Throttling and Debouncing

Avoid responding too often to input. Use timing or flags:

if (this.app.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.KEY_SPACE)) {
    // Only once when pressed
}

Or limit click frequency using cooldowns.


---

13.9 Preventing Input Overlap

To avoid UI + game input clashing, use flags or context awareness. Example:

if (!this.app.fire("ui:isFocused")) {
    // Accept game input
}

You can fire custom events from UI scripts to notify the rest of your game logic.


---

13.10 Best Practices

Centralize input logic per system (UI, camera, movement).

Separate real-time input from UI input handling.

Normalize controls across platforms.
