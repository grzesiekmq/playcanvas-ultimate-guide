Chapter 37: Localization and Internationalization

This chapter discusses techniques to make your PlayCanvas applications accessible and user-friendly across different languages and regions.

Understanding Localization vs. Internationalization

Internationalization (i18n): The process of designing your app so it can easily be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

Localization (l10n): The actual adaptation of your app’s content to a specific language and culture.


Preparing Your PlayCanvas Project

Use string resources stored externally (JSON or other formats) to manage text.

Avoid hardcoding text in scripts or UI elements.


Implementing Localization

1. Resource Files
Maintain language-specific files with key-value pairs for all user-facing strings.


2. Dynamic Text Replacement
Update UI elements at runtime based on selected language.


3. Fonts and Text Rendering
Choose fonts that support required character sets.


4. Formatting Dates, Numbers, and Currencies
Use JavaScript’s Intl API for locale-aware formatting.



Handling Directionality

Support for right-to-left (RTL) languages requires additional UI considerations.

Switching Languages at Runtime

Implement UI controls to allow users to switch languages without reloading the page.

Testing Localization

Test thoroughly to ensure all texts fit UI layouts and formatting behaves correctly.

Summary

Proper localization and internationalization increase your application's reach and user satisfaction, making it ready for global audiences.
