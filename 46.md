Chapter 46 – Audio Systems and Spatial Sound Optimization

Sound significantly enhances immersion in PlayCanvas applications. This chapter covers audio management, spatial sound, and performance considerations.

1. Audio Components in PlayCanvas

AudioSource: Plays audio clips attached to entities.

AudioListener: Represents the “ears” in the scene, usually attached to the camera.


2. Spatial Sound

Supports 3D positional audio, where volume and panning depend on listener position relative to the source.

Configure parameters such as rolloff, distance model, and doppler effect for realistic sound behavior.


3. Audio Formats and Compression

Use compressed formats like OGG or MP3 to reduce load times and memory footprint.

Consider fallback formats for cross-browser compatibility.


4. Performance Tips

Limit simultaneous sounds to prevent audio clipping and CPU overload.

Stop or pause sounds not currently audible.

Use streaming for long background music tracks.
