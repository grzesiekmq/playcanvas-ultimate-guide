Chapter 7: Scene Management and Entity Hierarchy

Efficient scene management and a well-structured entity hierarchy are key to building scalable PlayCanvas applications. This chapter explains how scenes work, how entities are organized, and how to manage complex level designs.


---

7.1 What is a Scene?

A scene in PlayCanvas represents a collection of entities arranged hierarchically, defining a specific game level, UI layout, or environment. Scenes can be saved, loaded, and switched at runtime.


---

7.2 Scene Files (.json)

PlayCanvas stores scenes as JSON files containing all entities and their components, including positions, rotations, and references to assets.

Scenes can be exported/imported via the editor or programmatically loaded.


---

7.3 Loading Scenes

Use the app.loadScene method to switch scenes:

app.loadScene('scene_id', function(err, scene) {
    if (!err) {
        app.root = scene.root;
    }
});

Scene loading is asynchronous, so you can display loading screens while waiting.


---

7.4 Entity Hierarchy

Entities form a tree with parent-child relationships.

Parent transforms affect children: moving a parent moves all its children.

Components are attached per entity: each entity can have multiple components.


Example:

var parent = new pc.Entity();
var child = new pc.Entity();
parent.addChild(child);


---

7.5 Managing Complex Hierarchies

Use empty or helper entities to group related objects logically.

Example: Group all lights under a "Lights" entity.

Example: Group UI elements under a "UI" entity.


This simplifies manipulation and scripting.


---

7.6 Scene Graph Operations

You can dynamically add, remove, or re-parent entities:

app.root.addChild(newEntity);
parent.removeChild(childEntity);
childEntity.reparent(newParentEntity);


---

7.7 Persistence and Serialization

Scene data can be serialized to JSON for saving game states or level editing.

Use entity.getJson() and entity.loadJson() for custom serialization workflows.


---

7.8 Scene Variants and Streaming

Split large levels into multiple scenes or sub-scenes and load them as needed to optimize memory usage.


---

7.9 Scene Optimization Tips

Cull entities outside the camera view.

Use LOD (Level of Detail) for models.

Disable or unload entities not needed immediately.



---

7.10 Best Practices

Keep entity hierarchies shallow to improve performance.

Name entities descriptively.

Use tags for grouping and querying entities at runtime.

Next Chapter: Chapter 8 covers scripting in PlayCanvas, focusing on writing modular and reusable scripts with lifecycle methods and attributes.
