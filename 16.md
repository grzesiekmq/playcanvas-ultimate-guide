Chapter 16: Audio in PlayCanvas

Audio is a vital component of immersive games and applications. PlayCanvas supports both 2D and 3D audio using the Web Audio API under the hood. This chapter explores how to use audio assets, control playback, implement spatial sound, and manage audio behavior via scripting.

16.1 Audio Assets

Before you can play a sound, you must:

1. Upload audio files (typically .mp3, .ogg, or .wav) to the Asset panel.


2. Set their type to "audio".


3. Optionally group them into sound slots within a Sound component.




---

16.2 The Sound Component

To use audio in an entity:

1. Add the sound component to an entity.


2. Define sound slots, each with its own audio asset and settings.



Example:

entity.addComponent('sound', {
    slots: {
        click: {
            asset: soundAsset,
            volume: 0.5,
            loop: false
        }
    }
});

To play the sound:

entity.sound.play('click');


---

16.3 2D vs 3D Sound

2D sounds are unaffected by listener position or orientation (UI clicks, music).

3D sounds attenuate and pan based on position in the scene (gunshots, engines).


To make a sound 3D:

entity.sound.slots['engine'].positional = true;

You can set distance attenuation models, min/max distance, and roll-off.


---

16.4 Controlling Audio via Script

You can play, pause, stop, and resume audio through scripting:

this.entity.sound.play('music');
this.entity.sound.pause('music');
this.entity.sound.stop('music');

You can also check if a sound is playing:

if (!this.entity.sound.slot('music').isPlaying) {
    this.entity.sound.play('music');
}


---

16.5 Ambient and Background Music

For looping background music:

1. Use a dedicated entity with a looping sound slot.


2. Set positional to false.


3. Adjust volume and use play() when needed (e.g. after menu load).



Example:

this.musicEntity.sound.play('ambientTrack');


---

16.6 3D Positional Audio

To simulate realistic 3D sound:

Attach audio sources to in-game objects (e.g., vehicles).

Ensure the listener is at the camera.

Fine-tune distance model parameters.


You can customize the spatial model:

entity.sound.slot('engine').setAttenuation('linear');


---

16.7 Volume Management

Control global or per-slot volume:

entity.sound.volume = 0.8; // all slots
entity.sound.slot('footsteps').volume = 0.5;

You can create a global audio manager script that adjusts volume in menus or based on user settings.


---

16.8 Audio Events and Triggers

Trigger sounds based on game events:

if (playerHealth <= 0) {
    this.entity.sound.play('gameover');
}

Or tie sounds to physics or animation events.


---

16.9 Performance Considerations

Preload essential sounds for lower latency.

Use compressed formats (e.g. .ogg) to reduce load times.

Avoid too many overlapping 3D sounds in complex scenes.



---

16.10 Best Practices

Normalize sound levels during asset prep.

Organize sounds into categories: UI, ambient, effects, music.

Use consistent naming for sound slots across entities.

Mute sound when the game is not in focus (optional).
