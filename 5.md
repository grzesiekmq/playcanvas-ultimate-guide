Chapter 5: Components in PlayCanvas

Components in PlayCanvas are modular building blocks attached to entities that provide specific functionality such as rendering models, playing audio, or controlling animations. Understanding how components work is essential to creating interactive and dynamic applications.


---

5.1 Overview of the Component System

Each entity in PlayCanvas acts as a container. Components define what an entity can do. Common components include:

model: for 3D mesh rendering

camera: for viewing the scene

light: for lighting the scene

script: to attach custom behaviors

rigidbody and collision: for physics interactions

element: for UI

sound: for audio playback

animation: for skeletal animation


Components are added either through the editor or programmatically.

5.2 Adding Components via Code

To add a component:

entity.addComponent('light', {
    type: 'directional',
    color: pc.Color.WHITE
});

Each component accepts a configuration object relevant to its type. For instance, the model component uses asset, type, and castShadows.

Removing a component:

entity.removeComponent('light');

Checking if a component exists:

if (entity.light) {
    entity.light.enabled = false;
}


---

5.3 Model Component

The model component is used to render 3D meshes. Types include 'box', 'sphere', 'asset', and more.

Example:

entity.addComponent('model', {
    type: 'box'
});

To assign a model asset:

entity.model.asset = app.assets.find('treeModel', 'model').id;


---

5.4 Camera Component

The camera component defines the view into the 3D scene. You can adjust:

fov

clearColor

projection

cullingMask


Example:

entity.addComponent('camera', {
    clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.1),
    fov: 60
});


---

5.5 Light Component

PlayCanvas supports three light types: directional, point, and spot.

entity.addComponent('light', {
    type: 'spot',
    color: pc.Color.YELLOW,
    range: 30
});

Shadows and intensity can be configured. Only a limited number of shadow-casting lights are supported on WebGL platforms.


---

5.6 Script Component

Attaches one or more scripts to an entity:

entity.addComponent('script');
entity.script.create('playerController');

You can pass parameters using attributes defined in the script file. The script component manages the lifecycle (initialize, update, postUpdate).


---

5.7 Physics Components: RigidBody & Collision

For physical interactions:

entity.addComponent('collision', {
    type: 'box',
    halfExtents: new pc.Vec3(1, 1, 1)
});

entity.addComponent('rigidbody', {
    type: 'dynamic',
    mass: 1
});

Use 'static', 'dynamic', or 'kinematic' rigid bodies depending on interaction type. Colliders must match the shape of your model or use primitives.


---

5.8 Element Component (UI)

For 2D UI rendering:

entity.addComponent('element', {
    type: 'text',
    text: 'Hello World',
    fontAsset: app.assets.find('Arial', 'font').id
});

element supports types: image, text, group, and screen.


---

5.9 Sound Component

entity.addComponent('sound', {
    volume: 0.5
});
entity.sound.addSlot('explosion', {
    asset: app.assets.find('explosion', 'audio'),
    loop: false
});
entity.sound.play('explosion');

Use slots for managing multiple sounds on a single entity.


---

5.10 Best Practices

Keep components modular: one entity, one responsibility.

Use child entities to separate visuals, logic, and collision.

Disable components instead of removing them to preserve state.

Use tags or naming conventions to group entities logically.
