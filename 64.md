Chapter 64 – Advanced Animation Blending and State Machines in PlayCanvas

Animation is a critical component of interactive applications and games. PlayCanvas supports a powerful animation state graph system, as well as runtime control over blending and transitions. This chapter covers advanced techniques for managing animations in character rigs, NPCs, UI, and more.

1. Animation System Overview

PlayCanvas uses two main systems:

Legacy animation system (older, still usable)

Animation state graph (modern, powerful, supports blending and logic)


Animation assets are imported with the model, typically as .glb or .fbx. Each animation can be assigned to a state in a state machine.


---

2. Using Animation State Graphs

State graphs are created inside the Animation component in the editor.

Features:

States (Idle, Walk, Jump, etc.)

Transitions with conditions

Blending between states

Parameters: triggers, booleans, numbers


Example state graph:

[Idle] ---> [Run] ---> [Jump]
   ^           |           |
   +-----------+-----------+


---

3. Parameters and Transition Conditions

Common parameters:

{
  "isRunning": true,
  "isJumping": false,
  "speed": 3.5
}

Set them in code:

entity.anim.setBoolean('isRunning', true);
entity.anim.setTrigger('jump');
entity.anim.setFloat('speed', 5.0);

Transitions can be conditional:

If speed > 0.1 → Walk

If isJumping == true → Jump



---

4. Animation Layering

PlayCanvas supports animation layering, e.g., playing upper-body animations like "wave" while legs continue to walk.

entity.anim.assignAnimationLayer("UpperBody", {
    mask: ["Spine", "Arm.L", "Arm.R"],
    blendType: pc.ANIM_LAYER_ADDITIVE
});

Layers allow additive or override blending for complex motion.


---

5. Manual Animation Control (Runtime API)

If you need more control:

entity.animation.play("Run", 0.2); // legacy API

Or override the state graph:

entity.anim.baseLayer.transition("Attack");

Pause, reverse, or jump to a frame:

const animTrack = entity.anim.baseLayer.activeState.animation;
animTrack.speed = -1.0; // reverse
animTrack.time = 1.5;   // jump to time


---

6. Handling Events During Animations

Use animation events embedded in .glb or added via the editor.

You can also listen via code:

entity.anim.on('footstep', function () {
    playFootstepSound();
});

Events make it easy to synchronize sounds, particles, or logic (e.g., combo hit detection).


---

7. Complex Blending Trees

For multiple directions (e.g., strafing, backward), use 2D blending:

// Parameters: moveX (-1 to 1), moveY (-1 to 1)
entity.anim.setFloat('moveX', input.x);
entity.anim.setFloat('moveY', input.y);

Combine this with blend trees in the editor to interpolate between:

Forward

Backward

Left / Right

Diagonals



---

8. Animation Retargeting (Advanced)

While not officially built-in, you can retarget animations between rigs if:

Skeletons match closely

Bone names are identical


Otherwise, use external tools (like Blender) to transfer animations, then import into PlayCanvas.


---

9. Performance Tips

Keep state graphs lean

Avoid too many active layers

Prefer GPU skinning (enabled by default)

Use baked animations when possible

Batch static entities to reduce draw calls



---

10. Use Cases

Character animation: walking, idling, attacking

UI animation: transitions, popup

Creatures/NPCs: varied AI-driven behaviors

Vehicles: animations for doors, suspension, etc.



---

Summary

PlayCanvas’s animation system, especially with state graphs and layering, provides powerful tools to create natural, responsive characters and dynamic scenes. Whether building complex characters or subtle UI transitions, mastering this system pays dividends in polish and immersion.
