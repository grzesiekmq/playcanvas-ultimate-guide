Chapter 56 – Replay Systems and Recording Gameplay

Replay systems and gameplay recording are key features in modern game development—especially for debugging, showcasing, and user-generated content. In this chapter, we’ll walk through how to build a replay system in PlayCanvas and how to implement recording features such as exporting gameplay as videos or GIFs.


---

1. What Are Replay Systems?

A replay system captures player actions or game states over time and allows them to be replayed deterministically. There are two main approaches:

State-based: capture the full game state each frame (e.g., position, velocity)

Input-based: capture player inputs and rebuild the game by replaying them


For web-based games like those built in PlayCanvas, input-based systems are usually more efficient.


---

2. Input Recording in PlayCanvas

Let’s record input over time (e.g., keyboard, mouse, controller):

const replayLog = [];

this.app.keyboard.on(pc.EVENT_KEYDOWN, (e) => {
    replayLog.push({ time: this.app.clock.now, type: 'keydown', key: e.key });
});

Extend to include:

Player positions

Mouse input

Game events (e.g., pickups, goals)



---

3. Storing and Exporting Replay Data

Store data in a format like JSON:

[
  { "time": 0.01, "type": "keydown", "key": "W" },
  { "time": 0.03, "type": "keyup", "key": "W" }
]

You can:

Save to localStorage

Upload to a server

Download as a .replay.json file



---

4. Playing Back a Replay

To replay, disable user input and feed recorded actions back into your game loop:

function playReplay(log) {
    let startTime = performance.now();
    log.forEach(event => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            handleEvent(event);
        }, event.time * 1000);
    });
}

Ensure your game is fully deterministic—physics, AI, and randomness must behave identically.


---

5. Determinism Tips

Use fixed time steps (app.timeScale)

Disable physics randomness (or seed it)

Avoid Math.random() in replay mode—use seeded RNG


For more reliable replays, log both inputs and key game states as checksums.


---

6. Game State Snapshots

For complex systems, save full snapshots periodically:

function snapshotState() {
    return {
        playerPos: player.getPosition().clone(),
        score: gameScore,
        inventory: [...inventory]
    };
}

Use these snapshots to correct drift or support rewind features.


---

7. Recording Video of Gameplay

Use the MediaRecorder API to capture canvas output:

const stream = app.graphicsDevice.canvas.captureStream(30);
const recorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);

recorder.ondataavailable = (e) => {
    chunks.push(e.data);
};

recorder.onstop = () => {
    const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'video/webm' });
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    downloadVideo(url);
};

recorder.start();

This gives you a .webm file after recording.


---

8. Saving GIFs

You can also capture frames and encode to GIF using libraries like gif.js:

const gif = new GIF({ workers: 2, quality: 10 });

gif.addFrame(canvas, { delay: 1000 / 30 });
gif.render();

However, GIF recording is CPU intensive and may cause frame drops.


---

9. Use Cases

Debugging: automatically record the last 30 seconds after a crash

Marketing: export clips or timelapses from gameplay

Esports: store replays of matches for review

User-Generated Content: allow players to share replays



---

10. Replay System Integration Tips

Allow replay export/import in UI

Add a timeline or controls for fast-forward/rewind

Support camera switching or freecam mode in replays

Sync audio with frame timing when recording



---

Summary: Replay and recording features add depth to your game and make testing and sharing easier. Start small with input recording, then evolve toward deterministic systems and full state replay.
