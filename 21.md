Chapter 21: Animation Systems

Animation plays a pivotal role in game development—bringing characters, environments, and objects to life. PlayCanvas provides a flexible animation system that supports both keyframe and skeletal animations, including runtime control, state machines, and blending.

21.1 The Animation Component

The animation component enables playback of legacy animation clips (non-skeletal) typically used for simple objects or pre-authored motion.

Usage:

Import .fbx files with embedded animations.

Add an animation component to your entity.

Assign the animation asset.

Control playback via script or component settings.


this.entity.animation.play('OpenDoor');

For newer workflows, use the Anim component instead.


---

21.2 The Anim Component (Modern System)

The anim component is a more advanced system used for skeletal animation with blending, layers, and state machines.

Benefits:

Full animation state graph.

Blend trees.

Layered animation.

Fine-grained control via script.



---

21.3 Creating Animation State Graphs

1. Select an entity with a skinned mesh and skeleton.


2. Add an Anim component.


3. Create a new State Graph asset.


4. Use the visual graph editor to define:



States (e.g., Idle, Walk, Run, Jump)

Transitions

Parameters (bools, triggers, floats)


Each state corresponds to an animation clip.


---

21.4 Animation Transitions and Parameters

Transitions between states can be based on conditions:

{
  "from": "Idle",
  "to": "Run",
  "conditions": [
    { "parameter": "isMoving", "equals": true }
  ]
}

Parameters can be defined in the graph and set via code:

this.entity.anim.setBoolean('isMoving', true);

For one-shot transitions (e.g. attack animation):

this.entity.anim.setTrigger('attack');


---

21.5 Scripting Anim Control

Example of full control over an anim graph:

this.entity.anim.setBoolean('isJumping', true);
this.entity.anim.setFloat('speed', 0.8);

You can listen to animation events (keyframe events) as well:

this.entity.anim.on('footstep', () => {
    this.app.fire('sound:play', 'footstep');
});


---

21.6 Animation Blending

To ensure smooth transitions between animations (e.g., Idle → Run), define a blend duration:

In the state graph, set blend time between transitions.

Avoid sudden snapping between poses.


For more advanced use cases, use blend trees (e.g., blend Walk and Run based on speed).


---

21.7 Multiple Animation Layers

Use multiple layers to overlay animations, such as:

Base layer: locomotion

Upper body: aim or shoot

Face: expressions


this.entity.anim.getLayer('UpperBody').setWeight(1.0);

Each layer can have its own graph and parameters.


---

21.8 Root Motion

If your animations move the character in world space (e.g., a jump forward), consider handling root motion manually.

PlayCanvas doesn’t support root motion extraction automatically. You’ll likely need to sync entity translation with animation:

// Apply forward motion based on animation frame
this.entity.translateLocal(0, 0, delta * speed);

Or rely on physics/colliders for movement.


---

21.9 Anim Events and Timeline Hooks

Animation clips can contain named events triggered during playback (e.g., attackStart, footstepLeft).

These events are exposed via script:

this.entity.anim.on('attackStart', () => {
    this.doDamage();
});

Define events inside your DCC tool or manually in imported animation assets.


---

21.10 Best Practices

Keep idle/locomotion/attack animations in separate clips.

Reuse skeletons between characters when possible.

Use animation compression to reduce load times.

Avoid long animation clips—break into modular actions.
