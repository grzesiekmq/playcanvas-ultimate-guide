Chapter 44 â€“ Physics Integration and Optimization

Physics simulations add realism to interactions in your PlayCanvas projects. Proper integration and optimization ensure smooth gameplay without sacrificing visual fidelity.

1. Physics Engines in PlayCanvas

PlayCanvas uses Ammo.js, a port of Bullet Physics, to provide rigid body dynamics, collisions, and constraints.

Supports rigid bodies, triggers, and joints for complex behaviors.


2. Setting Up Physics

Add RigidBody and Collision components to entities.

Configure mass, friction, restitution, and other physical properties.

Use triggers for detecting overlaps without physical response.


3. Performance Optimization

Minimize the number of active physics objects.

Use simplified collision shapes (boxes, spheres) rather than complex meshes.

Disable physics on inactive or distant objects.

Limit physics update rate if full precision is unnecessary.


4. Tips for Stable Simulations

Avoid very small or very large mass values.

Use constraints carefully to prevent jitter.

Synchronize physics updates with rendering loop for consistency.
