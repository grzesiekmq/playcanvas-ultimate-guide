Chapter 23: Physics Integration

Integrating physics into your PlayCanvas projects enables realistic movement, collisions, gravity, and interactive gameplay. PlayCanvas uses the Ammo.js physics engine, a port of the popular Bullet Physics Library compiled to WebAssembly.

23.1 Enabling Physics in PlayCanvas

To use physics:

Include the ammo.wasm.js and .wasm.wasm files.

Enable physics in your project settings.

Add the rigidbody and collision components to entities.


entity.addComponent('rigidbody', {
    type: 'dynamic',
    mass: 1
});
entity.addComponent('collision', {
    type: 'box',
    halfExtents: new pc.Vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
});


---

23.2 Rigid Body Types

There are three types of rigid bodies:

Static: Doesn't move (e.g., floors, walls).

Dynamic: Fully simulated (e.g., crates, vehicles).

Kinematic: Controlled manually (e.g., moving platforms).


Use the appropriate type for performance and behavior accuracy.


---

23.3 Collider Shapes

Collider shapes determine how objects collide:

Box

Sphere

Capsule

Cylinder

Mesh (expensive, use for static scenery)


Mesh colliders are only supported on static bodies.


---

23.4 Applying Forces and Impulses

You can apply forces and impulses to dynamic bodies:

// Apply a continuous force
entity.rigidbody.applyForce(0, 100, 0);

// Apply an instant impulse
entity.rigidbody.applyImpulse(0, 0, -50);

Use applyForce for gradual effects, applyImpulse for instant motion.


---

23.5 Collision Events

Listen for collisions using entity events:

entity.collision.on('collisionstart', function (result) {
    console.log('Collided with', result.other.name);
});

Available events:

collisionstart

collisionend

triggerenter

triggerleave


Use trigger volumes (non-physical colliders) for area detection.


---

23.6 Gravity and Global Settings

Global gravity is defined per scene:

app.systems.rigidbody.gravity.set(0, -9.81, 0);

Adjust timestep and solver iterations in the Editor’s Settings > Physics panel to fine-tune performance.


---

23.7 Character Controllers

PlayCanvas doesn’t have a built-in character controller, but you can build one using:

Kinematic bodies for direct control.

Raycasts for ground detection.

Movement constraints for walking/jumping.


Example structure:

if (app.keyboard.isPressed(pc.KEY_W)) {
    character.translateLocal(0, 0, -speed * dt);
}

Combine with collision detection to handle slopes and platforms.


---

23.8 Raycasting and Shape Casting

Raycasting is useful for AI, camera placement, and user interaction:

let from = new pc.Vec3(0, 10, 0);
let to = new pc.Vec3(0, -10, 0);
let result = app.systems.rigidbody.raycastFirst(from, to);

if (result) {
    console.log("Hit entity:", result.entity.name);
}

PlayCanvas also supports raycastAll for multiple hits.


---

23.9 Sleep and Wake

Physics bodies sleep to save performance. You can control this:

entity.rigidbody.sleep();
entity.rigidbody.wakeUp();

Prevent sleep with entity.rigidbody.sleepThreshold = 0.


---

23.10 Debugging Physics

Enable the physics debug renderer in the Editor or via script:

app.systems.rigidbody.renderPhysics = true;

This helps visualize colliders, forces, and active bodies for easier development and optimization.

Next Chapter: Chapter 24 will introduce Animation, including importing animations, blending, state graphs, and scripting dynamic motion.
