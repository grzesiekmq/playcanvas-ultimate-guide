Chapter 69 – Testing and Debugging PlayCanvas Projects


---

1. Introduction to Testing

Testing ensures your PlayCanvas project runs correctly and remains stable after changes. It includes:

Functional testing: Verify features behave as expected.

Performance testing: Check framerate and responsiveness.

Cross-browser/device testing: Ensure compatibility.



---

2. Debugging Techniques

Console logging: Use console.log() for tracing.

Breakpoints: Set breakpoints in browser dev tools to inspect variables and flow.

PlayCanvas Debug Panel: Monitor frame rate, draw calls, and script performance.

Error handling: Catch and manage exceptions to prevent crashes.



---

3. Unit Testing

While PlayCanvas doesn’t have built-in unit testing, you can write modular code for external testing using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.

Separate game logic from rendering where possible.



---

4. Profiling Tools

Use browser profiling to detect performance bottlenecks.

Use memory snapshots to find leaks.



---

5. Best Practices

Test frequently during development.

Automate where possible (CI/CD pipelines).

Use version control for easy rollback.



---

Summary

Testing and debugging are essential to deliver reliable PlayCanvas projects. Combining good coding practices with available tools will help maintain code quality.
