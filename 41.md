Chapter 41: Animation System and Keyframe Management

This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to PlayCanvas's animation system, focusing on importing, managing, and controlling keyframe animations.

Animation Types

Skeletal Animation: Uses bone hierarchies to animate characters or objects.

Morph Targets: Animates vertex positions for facial expressions or shape changes.

Property Animations: Animations of entity properties like position, rotation, scale, or material parameters.


Importing Animations

Supported formats: FBX and glTF commonly carry skeletal and morph animations.

Import animations along with models into the PlayCanvas asset pipeline.


Animation Component

Attach the Animation component to entities to control playback.

Supports multiple animation clips, blending, crossfading, and events.


Controlling Animations via Scripts

Play, pause, stop animations programmatically.

Blend animations smoothly using weights.

Listen for animation events to trigger game logic.


Advanced Techniques

Animation Blending: Combine multiple animations for natural transitions.

Animation Masks: Limit animation effects to certain bones or properties.

Inverse Kinematics (IK): Implement IK via scripts or external libraries.


Performance Considerations

Optimize animations by reducing keyframe density.

Use GPU skinning when available.


Summary

Mastering PlayCanvasâ€™s animation system allows for rich, dynamic character and object movements, enhancing the realism and interactivity of your projects.
