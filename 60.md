Chapter 60 – Building and Debugging WebXR Apps on Mobile Devices

Testing WebXR experiences on desktop is only half the battle. Since many users will access your PlayCanvas-based AR or VR apps from mobile devices, real-device testing is essential. This chapter walks you through setup, deployment, debugging, and profiling techniques for mobile WebXR development.


---

1. Preparing the PlayCanvas App

Ensure that your PlayCanvas scene:

Enables XR (this.app.xr.supported)

Supports both inline and immersive sessions

Is deployed over HTTPS (required for XR APIs)


If needed:

if (this.app.xr.supported && navigator.xr) {
    navigator.xr.isSessionSupported('immersive-vr').then((supported) => {
        if (supported) {
            // Show VR enter button
        }
    });
}


---

2. Mobile Browser Requirements

✅ Chrome for Android

Supports both AR and VR WebXR (on Android 10+).

✅ Samsung Internet

Also supports WebXR, often with fewer bugs than Chrome.

❌ iOS Safari

As of now, no full WebXR support, but WebAR is possible using third-party libraries like 8thWall or Niantic’s 8thWall-style polyfills.

3. Hosting Your App

Options:

PlayCanvas built-in hosting (launch.playcanvas.com)

Netlify/Vercel (great for quick deployments)

GitHub Pages (if static)


Verify HTTPS and CORS headers are correct—some mobile browsers block XR if these are missing.


---

4. Remote Debugging with Chrome

You can debug mobile devices using Chrome DevTools:

1. Connect phone via USB


2. Enable developer mode on phone


3. Open chrome://inspect in desktop Chrome


4. Open your app on mobile Chrome


5. Click “Inspect” next to your mobile tab



This gives full access to:

Console logs

Network requests

DOM/JS memory snapshots

Remote screen view



---

5. XR Session Lifecycle on Mobile

Handle common lifecycle events:

this.app.xr.on('start', function () {
    console.log('XR session started');
});
this.app.xr.on('end', function () {
    console.log('XR session ended');
});

Also monitor visibilitychange and device orientation:

document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
    if (document.hidden) {
        // Pause timers, animations, audio
    }
});


---

6. Performance Constraints on Mobile

Lower draw call budgets (~50–100)

Limited GPU bandwidth and RAM

Heavy scenes = lag, overheating, dropped frames


Use PlayCanvas’s profiler (F10) on desktop first, then validate on mobile.


---

7. Testing AR Features on Mobile

AR-specific tips:

Test in well-lit, flat environments

Ensure WebXR AR permissions are granted

Track session availability with:


navigator.xr.isSessionSupported('immersive-ar')

Use debug visuals (e.g., placing a plane or a reticle) to confirm surface detection works correctly.


---

8. Deploying to Oculus Quest

Although this chapter focuses on mobile phones, the Quest series runs Android and Chrome-based WebXR apps.

Deploying to Quest:

Use Oculus Browser

Enable Developer Mode in Oculus App

Use https:// URLs

Launch using navigator.xr.requestSession('immersive-vr')



---

9. Logs, Crashes, and Error Recovery

Mobile crashes are hard to track. Recommendations:

Log to console.log and store errors locally with localStorage

Use window.onerror to catch JS crashes

Use navigator.xr.ondevicechange to track headset connect/disconnect events


Optional: Integrate with tools like Sentry or LogRocket for error reporting.


---

10. Final Checklist

✅ Hosted over HTTPS
✅ Mobile browser supports XR
✅ Scene performance tested
✅ Errors handled and logged
✅ Device permissions granted
✅ XR session fallback logic ready
✅ Touch and orientation inputs validated


---

Summary

Building WebXR apps for mobile isn’t just about coding—it’s about deployment pipelines, device quirks, and runtime constraints. Equip yourself with strong debugging tools and anticipate real-world conditions to deliver truly immersive, reliable mobile experiences.
