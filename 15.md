Chapter 15: User Interface (UI) in PlayCanvas

Creating responsive and interactive user interfaces is essential in modern web games and applications. PlayCanvas offers a 2D screen-space UI system built on top of its Entity Component System. This chapter explores how to design, build, and control UI using the screen and element components.

15.1 The UI System Architecture

The PlayCanvas UI system is structured around two core components:

screen component – Defines a canvas-like space for UI rendering.

element component – Used on child entities to define visual elements such as text, images, or interactive areas.


All UI elements must exist under an entity with a screen component.


---

15.2 Creating a UI Hierarchy

In the Editor:

1. Create an entity and add the screen component.


2. Set Screen Space to true (for HUDs) or false (for world-space UI).


3. Add child entities with element components for text, images, and buttons.



You can organize the UI with containers and use anchors and pivots to control layout.


---

15.3 The element Component

The element component has three primary types:

Image – Displays a texture or sprite.

Text – Renders styled text.

Group – Organizes nested UI.


Example:

entity.addComponent("element", {
    type: "text",
    text: "Score: 0",
    fontSize: 32,
    color: [1, 1, 1]
});


---

15.4 Anchoring and Positioning

Anchors define the attachment of an element relative to its parent or screen:

Use anchors to make responsive layouts.

Set pivot (origin) and margins to control spacing.


Example: Top-left corner UI

element.anchor = [0, 1, 0, 1];
element.pivot = [0, 1];
element.margin = [10, -10, 0, 0];


---

15.5 Button Interaction

To make interactive buttons:

1. Add an element of type image or text.


2. Add a script that listens for pointer events:



this.entity.element.on('pointerdown', function (event) {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
}, this);

You can also handle mouseenter, mouseleave, and touchstart.


---

15.6 Responsive UI Design

Tips for flexible UI:

Use anchors and percentage-based positioning.

Group elements with containers.

Adjust reference resolution and scale mode in the screen component.


PlayCanvas handles pixel density scaling for different devices.


---

15.7 UI in World Space

To create floating 3D UI (e.g., over characters):

Set screen space to false.

Attach screen entity to a world-space object.

Use LookAt or camera-facing scripts to orient UI.



---

15.8 Custom Fonts and Images

Fonts are imported via .ttf files, converted in the Editor.

UI images must be set up with texture assets and optional sprite atlases.



---

15.9 UI Scripting Tips

Cache references to UI entities during initialize.

Update UI text via:


this.entity.element.text = "New value";

Disable/enable UI dynamically with .enabled = false.



---

15.10 Debugging UI

Use the Editor’s "Hierarchy" view to inspect anchors and pivots.

Use browser dev tools to inspect canvas resolution and scaling.

Log layout info with entity.element.anchor, margin, and pivot.
