Chapter 38: Performance Profiling and Optimization

This chapter covers tools and techniques to analyze and improve the performance of your PlayCanvas applications, ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences.

Profiling Tools

Browser Developer Tools: Use built-in tools like Chrome DevTools to profile JavaScript, monitor memory usage, and analyze rendering performance.

PlayCanvas Stats Panel: Provides real-time stats on frame rate, draw calls, and memory.

Third-party Tools: Tools like Spector.js allow GPU debugging and inspection.


Identifying Bottlenecks

CPU-bound issues: Heavy JavaScript execution, complex logic, or inefficient loops.

GPU-bound issues: High draw calls, overdraw, or expensive shaders.

Memory leaks: Objects not properly released, leading to performance degradation.


Optimization Techniques

Reduce Draw Calls: Use batching and instancing to minimize state changes.

Level of Detail (LOD): Swap models based on camera distance.

Efficient Scripts: Avoid heavy computations in update loops; cache values.

Texture Optimization: Use compressed textures and appropriate resolutions.

Culling: Use frustum and occlusion culling to avoid rendering unseen objects.

Minimize Overdraw: Avoid rendering overlapping transparent objects unnecessarily.

Garbage Collection Management: Avoid creating many temporary objects inside loops.


Profiling Workflow

1. Identify performance issues.


2. Isolate problematic code or assets.


3. Apply optimizations.


4. Re-profile to verify improvements.



Summary

Systematic profiling and optimization ensure that your PlayCanvas applications perform well across devices, delivering a high-quality user experience.
