Chapter 30: Multiplayer and Networking

Modern web games increasingly rely on multiplayer features, whether for cooperative experiences, PvP mechanics, or persistent online worlds. PlayCanvas, while primarily a client-side engine, can be effectively integrated with external networking libraries and services to build real-time multiplayer experiences.


---

30.1 Architecture Overview

PlayCanvas itself doesn't provide a built-in networking stack, so developers usually integrate it with:

WebSocket-based servers (e.g. Node.js + ws)

WebRTC (peer-to-peer networking, suitable for small-scale lobbies)

Third-party services like Colyseus, Socket.io, Firebase Realtime DB, or Nakama


Basic architecture:

[Client A] ←→ [Server] ←→ [Client B]
     ↑                           ↑
 PlayCanvas             PlayCanvas

The server handles message routing, validation, and world state. Clients receive deltas or events to update their local state.


---

30.2 WebSocket Integration

Start with a simple WebSocket client:

var Multiplayer = pc.createScript('multiplayer');

Multiplayer.prototype.initialize = function() {
    this.socket = new WebSocket('wss://yourserver.example.com');

    this.socket.onopen = () => {
        console.log('Connected to server');
    };

    this.socket.onmessage = (msg) => {
        var data = JSON.parse(msg.data);
        this.handleMessage(data);
    };

    this.socket.onerror = (err) => console.error(err);
};

Multiplayer.prototype.send = function(data) {
    this.socket.send(JSON.stringify(data));
};

This sets up a basic connection and enables sending/receiving structured messages.


---

30.3 State Synchronization

You'll need to determine:

Who is authoritative (client or server)?

What data is sent (position, velocity, animation state)?

How often to sync (e.g. 20 ticks per second)?


Example: Syncing a player’s position:

Client sends:

{ "type": "update", "pos": [3.5, 0, -2.1] }

Server validates, then rebroadcasts to others.

To interpolate smoothly on remote clients:

this.remotePos.lerp(this.remotePos, newPos, dt * smoothingFactor);


---

30.4 Lag Compensation & Interpolation

Due to latency, directly snapping object positions leads to jitter. Use:

Interpolation for remote entities

Prediction for local input (especially movement)

Lag buffers to render a few frames in the past


This smooths motion and keeps gameplay responsive.


---

30.5 Example: Multiplayer Avatar

Each player controls an avatar. The client sends movement inputs, and the server responds with confirmed positions. On client:

this.app.on('network:update', function(data) {
    // Update remote avatar positions
    avatars[data.id].setPosition(data.pos);
});


---

30.6 Using Colyseus

Colyseus is a state-sync-focused multiplayer server framework for Node.js with WebSocket support and room/lobby abstractions.

Client setup:

import * as Colyseus from 'colyseus.js';

const client = new Colyseus.Client('wss://yourserver.com');
const room = await client.joinOrCreate("my_room");

room.onStateChange((state) => {
    // handle authoritative state
});

PlayCanvas integration is seamless with script events and data binding.


---

30.7 Hosting Your Server

Options:

Node.js on VPS or dedicated host

Heroku, Render, Railway for small-scale projects

Firebase or Supabase for more state/event-based architectures

WebRTC for peer-to-peer, using libraries like PeerJS


Always ensure TLS (wss://) in production for secure connections.


---

30.8 Synchronizing More Than Movement

Extend syncing to:

Animations (isRunning, isJumping)

Chat messages

Projectiles (spawn time and trajectory)

Game state (scores, timers)


Define a clear schema and versioning to handle future updates.


---

30.9 Networking Performance Tips

Compress and throttle data (zlib, binary formats like Protocol Buffers)

Avoid sending full world state every frame — use deltas

Disconnect inactive clients to preserve resources

Consider tick-rate balancing (e.g. 20Hz server, 60Hz render)



---

30.10 Security Considerations

Never trust the client

Validate all inputs on the server

Implement rate limiting and authentication

Consider using a separate game state server and a database backend
