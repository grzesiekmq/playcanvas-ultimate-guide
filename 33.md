Chapter 33: Animation Systems

Animation brings life to 3D models, and PlayCanvas offers flexible systems to animate characters, props, and UI elements. This chapter explores skeletal animation, morph targets, and blending techniques in PlayCanvas.


---

33.1 Types of Animations

Skeletal (Skinning): Animates bones influencing vertices.

Morph Targets (Blend Shapes): Vertex positions interpolate between target shapes.

Node-based animations: Entity transforms animated individually.



---

33.2 Skeletal Animation in PlayCanvas

PlayCanvas supports skeletal animation via AnimationComponent and SkinInstance.

Import models with bones and animations (FBX, glTF).

Play animations by name or blending multiple.


Example:

var anim = entity.animation;
anim.play('Run');


---

33.3 Animation Blending

Smooth transitions between animations improve realism.

PlayCanvas provides:

Crossfade: Transition from one animation to another over time.

Layered animations: Play multiple animations on different bones.


Example crossfade:

anim.crossFade('Walk', 'Run', 0.5);


---

33.4 Morph Targets

Useful for facial expressions or complex deformations.

In PlayCanvas:

Morph targets are part of the mesh asset.

Adjust weights at runtime:


entity.model.meshInstances[0].morphInstance.setWeight(0, 0.75);


---

33.5 Animation Events and Callbacks

Detect when animation loops or finishes:

anim.on('animationend', function(name) {
    console.log(name + ' finished');
});


---

33.6 Controlling Animation Speed

Adjust speed dynamically:

anim.speed = 1.5; // 1.5x normal speed


---

33.7 Blending and Mixing Advanced

Use AnimationComponentLayer for advanced layering:

var layer1 = anim.layers[0];
var layer2 = anim.layers[1];

layer1.play('Run');
layer2.play('Shoot');
layer2.weight = 0.7;


---

33.8 Performance Considerations

Limit simultaneous animated entities.

Reuse animations where possible.

Bake animations if static.



---

33.9 Animation Tools Integration

Use external tools (Blender, Maya) to create animations.

Export with glTF for best PlayCanvas compatibility.

Use animation retargeting cautiously.



---

33.10 Summary

PlayCanvasâ€™s animation system is versatile and performant, allowing complex character animation, facial expressions, and smooth transitions.
