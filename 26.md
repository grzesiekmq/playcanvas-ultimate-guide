Chapter 26: Post-Processing

Post-processing in PlayCanvas allows you to apply visual effects after the main scene rendering, enhancing the final image with polish and cinematic flair. These effects are typically implemented using screen-space shaders and applied as a final pass to the rendered frame.


---

26.1 What Is Post-Processing?

It refers to rendering effects applied to the camera output, such as:

Bloom

Color Grading

Vignette

Film Grain

Depth of Field

Motion Blur

Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)

Custom image effects


These are not part of the main 3D rendering pipeline but are layered afterward using full-screen quad shaders.

26.2 Enabling Post-Processing

PlayCanvas doesn’t include built-in post-processing by default. To add it:

1. Create a script that uses pc.PostEffect.


2. Register it with the camera's post-effects queue.


3. Handle shader creation and rendering.



Example skeleton:

class MyEffect extends pc.PostEffect {
    constructor(graphicsDevice, vs, fs) {
        super(graphicsDevice);
        this.shader = new pc.Shader(graphicsDevice, {
            attributes: { aPosition: pc.SEMANTIC_POSITION },
            vshader: vs,
            fshader: fs
        });
    }

    render(inputTarget, outputTarget, rect) {
        this.device.setRenderTarget(outputTarget);
        this.device.updateBegin();
        this.shader.draw(inputTarget, rect);
        this.device.updateEnd();
    }
}

Attach your effect using:

cameraEntity.camera.postEffects.addEffect(new MyEffect(...));

26.3 Common Effects

Bloom
Simulates light bleeding from bright areas.

Depth of Field
Blurs distant or near objects to simulate camera lens behavior.

Color Grading / LUT
Applies a Lookup Table texture to remap colors for cinematic looks.

Vignette
Darkens screen corners to focus the viewer’s attention.


---

26.4 Chaining Effects

Post-effects can be chained in sequence:

camera.camera.postEffects.addEffect(bloomEffect);
camera.camera.postEffects.addEffect(vignetteEffect);

Be mindful of GPU cost; each effect consumes bandwidth and fill rate.


---

26.5 Using External Libraries

Some developers use PostProcessing Stack or adapt filters from glfx.js. These can speed up implementation of effects like CRT, scanlines, or tilt-shift.


---

26.6 Custom Post Effects

Write your own post effect using GLSL:

// Simple invert fragment shader
void main(void) {
    vec4 color = texture2D(uColorBuffer, vUv0);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(1.0 - color.rgb), color.a);
}

Use uColorBuffer for the original screen texture. You can pass uniforms like time, resolution, or user input to drive animations.


---

26.7 Optimization Tips

Keep your shader lightweight.

Avoid unnecessary samples or texture fetches.

Use a single fullscreen quad.

Use shared render targets to avoid memory overhead.



---

26.8 Debugging

Test on target devices (especially mobile).

Monitor FPS and memory usage.

Toggle effects on/off to isolate performance issues.



---

26.9 Editor Integration

There’s no official GUI for post-processing in the PlayCanvas Editor. However, you can:

Expose toggles in the Script Attributes panel.

Use script order to organize effect stacking.

Create in-editor UI for debugging via pc.createScript.



---

26.10 Use Cases

Cinematics and cutscenes.

Simulating camera lenses (DoF, bokeh).

Stylized rendering (cel shading, pixelate).

Enhancing realism or tone (LUT, bloom, ambient occlusion).
