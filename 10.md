Chapter 10: Animation System in PlayCanvas

Animations bring life to your game characters and objects. PlayCanvas supports keyframe animations, skeletal rigs, and animation blending, enabling smooth and dynamic motion.


---

10.1 Animation Types

Keyframe Animation: Animates entity properties like position, rotation, and scale.

Skeletal Animation: Uses bones and skinning for complex character animations.

Morph Targets: For mesh shape changes (facial expressions, etc.).



---

10.2 Animation Assets

Animations are imported as assets (typically in FBX or glTF formats) and managed via the Asset Registry.


---

10.3 Animation Component

Entities with a model can have an animation component which controls playback.

Basic usage:

entity.addComponent('animation', {
    assets: [animationAssetId],
    speed: 1
});
entity.animation.play('run');


---

10.4 Animation Blending

PlayCanvas supports blending multiple animations for smooth transitions, like blending walk and run cycles.


---

10.5 Scripting Animations

Control animations via scripts:

entity.animation.play('jump');
entity.animation.stop();
entity.animation.speed = 2.0;


---

10.6 Animation Events

Animations can trigger events at specific frames for gameplay logic (e.g., footstep sounds).


---

10.7 Best Practices

Optimize animation assets for performance.

Use blending for smooth transitions.

Keep animation names consistent.

Reuse animations where possible.
