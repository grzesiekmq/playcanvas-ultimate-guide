Chapter 35: Asset Pipeline and Compression

This chapter focuses on managing assets efficiently in PlayCanvas, covering how to optimize your asset pipeline and apply compression techniques to improve loading times and runtime performance.

Asset Pipeline Overview

Assets include models, textures, audio files, scripts, and other resources used in your project. Efficient management ensures faster load times and reduced memory usage.

Importing Assets: Supported formats include FBX, OBJ for models; PNG, JPG for textures; WAV, MP3 for audio.

Asset Optimization: Reducing polygon count, resizing textures, and compressing audio files are essential steps.

Asset Dependencies: Managing dependencies ensures all necessary resources load correctly.


Texture Compression

Texture compression reduces file sizes and memory usage without significantly sacrificing visual quality.

Formats: Use formats like DXT, ETC, or ASTC depending on target platforms.

Mipmapping: Generate mipmaps to improve texture scaling and performance.

Compression Tools: Utilize external tools or PlayCanvas's built-in features to compress textures.


Model Optimization

Polygon Reduction: Use tools like Blender or MeshLab to lower polygon counts.

Level of Detail (LOD): Implement multiple model versions for varying detail based on camera distance.

Baking Textures: Bake lighting and shadows into textures to reduce real-time computations.


Audio Compression

Formats: Prefer compressed formats like OGG or MP3 for background music.

Sampling Rates: Lower sample rates reduce file size but may affect quality.


Asset Bundling

Grouping assets into bundles can optimize loading by allowing selective download of needed assets.

Automation and Build Process

Automate asset processing in your build pipeline to maintain consistency and efficiency.

Summary

Optimizing assets through compression and pipeline management is critical for performance, especially for web and mobile platforms where bandwidth and memory are limited.
