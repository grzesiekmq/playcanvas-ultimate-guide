Chapter 27: Physics

Physics simulation is an essential component in interactive 3D applications and games. In PlayCanvas, physical behavior is handled using Ammo.js, a WebAssembly port of the Bullet Physics engine. This allows developers to create realistic motion, collisions, gravity, and other dynamics.

27.1 Enabling Physics

To enable physics in a scene:

1. Activate the Physics Engine – PlayCanvas does this automatically when entities with physics components exist.


2. Add RigidBody Components – This makes objects affected by physical forces.


3. Add Collision Components – These define the shape of an object for detecting contact.



You can add these via the Editor or through code:

entity.addComponent("rigidbody", {
    type: "dynamic",
    mass: 1
});

entity.addComponent("collision", {
    type: "box",
    halfExtents: new pc.Vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
});


---

27.2 Rigid Body Types

Static: Immovable objects (e.g. floor, walls).

Dynamic: Fully simulated (e.g. crates, players).

Kinematic: Moved via code but interact with other bodies.


Use the correct type for performance and realism.


---

27.3 Collision Shapes

Shapes approximate physical geometry:

Box

Sphere

Capsule

Cylinder

Mesh (static only)


Choosing simpler shapes improves performance. For complex visuals, use a basic collider shape and keep the mesh separate.


---

27.4 Forces and Impulses

Apply motion dynamically using:

entity.rigidbody.applyForce(new pc.Vec3(0, 100, 0));
entity.rigidbody.applyImpulse(new pc.Vec3(10, 0, 0), entity.getPosition());

Use applyForce for continuous push (e.g., wind), and applyImpulse for sudden jolts (e.g., explosion).


---

27.5 Gravity

By default, gravity is applied as (0, -9.8, 0).

To change it globally:

this.app.systems.rigidbody.gravity.set(0, -20, 0);

Disable gravity for an entity by setting its rigidbody to kinematic or overriding its behavior via scripting.


---

27.6 Collision Events

Listen for collisions using:

entity.collision.on('collisionstart', function (result) {
    console.log("Collided with", result.other.name);
});

Events include:

collisionstart

collisionend

triggerenter

triggerleave


Use triggers (no rigidbody) for zones like checkpoints, damage areas, or pickups.


---

27.7 Joint Constraints

Constraints connect two bodies:

Hinge – Like a door.

Point-to-point – Loose connection.

Slider – Linear-only movement.


Available via scripting using pc.createConstraint, but require manual setup and fine-tuning.


---

27.8 Physics Debugging

Enable debug visuals using:

this.app.systems.rigidbody.drawDebug = true;

You’ll see wireframe outlines of collision shapes. Useful for detecting mismatched scales, misplaced colliders, or wrong rigidbody types.


---

27.9 Best Practices

Keep mass realistic; too small/large causes instability.

Avoid nesting dynamic bodies under other entities.

Use compound shapes carefully – only for complex objects.

Deactivate unused bodies via enabled = false for optimization.



---

27.10 Limitations

Mesh colliders are static only.

High-speed collisions may require ccdMotionThreshold for better accuracy.

Limited support for soft bodies, ragdolls, or advanced constraints.
